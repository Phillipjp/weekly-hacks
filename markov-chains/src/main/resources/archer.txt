Sterling Archer.
Code name Duchess.
Hm.
Known from Berlin to Bangkok as the world's most dangerous spy.
So for us, this is How you say? - A good get.
But not so good for you, Mr.
Archer.
Because you have information that I want.
And this may be old cliché but we have ways of making you talk.
What? Your little go-cart battery? - Golf cart.
- Whatever.
- Would you pick an accent and stick with it? - Listen here Son of a bitch.
- Now you did it.
- What is the point of these simulations - Krenshaw's arousal? if you don't take them seriously? How can I? Between his lame accent and the go-cart battery - Golf cart.
- Shut up.
And speaking of lame, my code name Was chosen at random by the ISIS computer.
Random? It was your dog's name.
Oh, Duchess.
I loved her so much.
That it was creepy and pathetic? And if you were half as smart as she was She wasn't too smart to die from eating chocolate, was she? Exercise terminated.
- All right, that's lunch then.
- Agent performance unsatisfactory.
Oh, come on At worst, that was "needs improvement.
" - Jesus, Archer.
- What? - You think this is a game? - No, I think Jenga is a game.
What if I'd been real KGB? I assume you'd try to suck a promotion out of some Russian guy's cock.
- Maybe I never get promoted - Never will.
because my mommy's not the boss.
And maybe you just got your face kicked off.
That is my foot in your face.
Smell the embarrass Ow, oh! Mother, did you see that? Mother.
Mother.
Leave a message at the tone.
Um Tone.
This is Four-Five-Six Laundry.
Your shirts are ready for a week.
Oh, no.
- Good morning.
- Hey, you.
I'm so hungry.
Just give me five minutes on my backhand then we'll see if there's a - Is that a dog? Is it a dog? - Oui, that is Abelard.
Oh, adorable.
Now get the hell out of here.
But you promised me breakfast.
You want breakfast? Try the diner.
You're obviously into Greek.
Get it? Thank you, Abelard.
- It's a short list, Woodhouse.
Yes, sir.
- Things we don't allow in.
What are they? - Dogs and your mother.
- That's a very short list, isn't it? - Yes but you were quite insistent - What was I? that an exception be made.
No, no, no, because forget the dog rule, because this pug is amazing.
Watch this.
Abergard, go.
Do you not hear that? That's "Puttin' on the Ritz," man.
- I'm always insistent, Woodhouse.
- Yes, sir.
- But I'm not to be trusted, am I? - No, sir.
Stop.
Shut up.
I have to go.
But if I find one single dog hair when I get back I'll rub sand in your dead little eyes.
Very good, sir.
- I also need you to go buy sand.
- Yes, sir.
I don't know if they grade it but Coarse.
One entire whole week we've been calling you.
Highly unprofessional.
Really? Because I find your sweatiness unprofessional.
So we have something in common.
Besides the fact that now both of our shirts reek of curry.
- And when will you settle your account? - When will you buy some dress shields? - This is not a dress.
- Are you serious? That's not a dress? Oh, God, with the curry again.
This shirt smells like Indira Gandhi's thong.
- Hey, you wanna smell something? - Swear to God, Mr.
Archer I have H.
R.
On speed dial.
- Shut up.
Hey, Krieger, you gotta smell this.
Krieger? Huh.
You geeks wanna smell something? - Archer, get the hell out.
- What is it with you people? Try to include people in your life and then you Lana.
Hey.
Hey, what does this smell like? Like the dysfunctional asshole I broke up with six months ago.
Oh, my God.
You're amazing.
You are amazing, sweet stuff.
Wanna do it again and put on some interracial porn? God, it's like my brain's that tree, and you're those little cookie elves.
Just a second.
- No, baby, don't answer that.
- I have to.
Sorry, it's Mother.
- Mother, hey.
Just a second.
- I cannot believe you.
No, turn it on.
I can do both.
- What? - So don't speak to me, ever.
And while you're not ever speaking to me, jump up your own ass and die.
Oh, rea After all that H.
R.
Mediation.
Really? - Yup.
- After all the hard work Pam did.
- Is that Archer? - Goddamn it.
- Archer, hey.
- Go away.
- About your operations account - Not - Cyril, not now.
- Yes, now.
- Not a good time.
- You've got serious discrepancies in your account.
- No, Cyril.
I'm sure you wouldn't use operational funds for personal expenses.
Come on, 22 black.
Twenty-two black.
Twenty-two.
Black.
Ass.
Son of a bitch.
Heh.
Not you, giant African man.
I'm sorry.
Can I offer you a drink? How about this expensive prostitute? That is a very serious implication, Cyril.
Well, so is embezzlement.
Yeah? Well, so is the fact that you, some crazy-how, are screwing my ex.
- Archer, please.
That's private.
- Not calm enough? You all know about Cyril and Lana, right? Of course, because if Pam knows, then everybody knows because of Pam's huge mouth.
Right, Pam? H.
R.
Mediations are supposed to be confidential, Pam, you manatee.
- And as for you, Cyril, good day, sir.
- Archer.
Hey, wait.
What about your account? Oh, I get it.
Classic misdirection.
No, don't.
You're so ugly when you cry.
- Mr.
Archer.
- I'm fine.
Is she in or out eating a baby? - You stood me up again last night.
- Last? Oh, yeah.
Oh, my.
What happened was Did you see Brian's Song? Same thing pretty much happened.
I helped a guy with cancer.
Look, I'm really sorry, Carol, but I couldn't It's Cheryl.
I know, Ca Cheryl.
So to make it up to you - I'm ready.
could you buzz me in? Ugh.
Is that all you have to say? Yes.
Now tell me again how No, not that part.
Go back.
Yes.
The pepper.
Oh, yes, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, goddamn it.
What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? L I'm For your information, I've just been reviewing your operations account.
- No.
No.
No.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
- No.
No.
And it makes for fascinating reading.
- No.
- Let's see.
You turned in an expense report from Berlin where the German desk says you never checked in.
- Oh, Berlin was - Ditto Buenos Aires.
- Too busy to check in? - There was Yeah.
Already off to Monaco? - I'm spying.
- Or was it Mallorca? Oh.
- Or Tunis? - Tunis kind of rings a bell.
ISIS isn't your own personal travel agency.
It doesn't exist just so you can jet off to Whore Island.
That's not a real place.
I have 50 agents who'd literally kill to move up to your position.
If you don't square your operations account by Monday they won't need to.
Your position will be vacant.
- Sterling.
- Hm? Sorry.
I was picturing Whore Island.
Have I made myself clear? Are you? You're looking for the answer "yes"? - Yes.
Good.
- Then, yes.
Then get out.
And for God's sake, take a shower.
Smells like a whorehouse in here.
Okay.
Your own fingers.
- Hm? - Nothing.
Johnny Bench called.
So here's the thing.
I need to access my operations account and you're preventing that.
Now, we can do this easy or we can do it hard.
Your call.
No? Hard it is then.
- Oh, God, sorry.
Goddamn it, Archer.
- I forgot that Did I get you? What is wrong with you? Me? Nothing.
You, on the other hand, have a bullet inside you.
- I see the foot's all better.
- And I see you're still a hatchet-face prick.
- Do you see that sign? - Do you see that sign? - Well - That's why.
So we don't get ants.
Because when your co-workers put food in the refrigerator that's a bond of trust, okay? And if you violate that trust, or the food, there's There's my favorite section head.
I am dealing with the break room problem.
Oh, good.
You caught the Oh, wait I had something for this.
- The Pita Predator.
- You know what? Sorry.
Let's just call it what it is.
- Food rapist.
- Not a pretty name, is it? Pam, if you want some food that's supposed to be cream-filled I offer these delicious doughnuts.
Yeah? - In exchange for a favor.
- A favor? - Yeah.
After how you treated me? - **** your dolphin, Pam.
Archer, she's down, all right? - Your ******* dolphin.
She's tapping out.
- You.
- I think she peed.
I had to get three stitches.
And I broke my watch.
And I'm sorry for that.
- Three - But I need your help, Pam, because I'm um, conducting a mole hunt.
- Aah.
- Gasp you should because if you let me in the mainframe, I'll drop these doughnuts.
Then you can pretend they're marbles and you're a hungry, hungry hungry hippo.
Lana.
Hey, I know I'm supposed to be up my own ass right now but - Oh, is that what you want? Yup.
- Because that's how you get ants.
Yay.
Cyril, my favorite section head.
- What do you want? - To apologize for my behavior.
- Well - And also to - What are you doing? - Oh, just dicing veggies for dinner.
- I always make Lana stir-fry on Friday.
- Neat.
Listen - Guess what we call it.
- Stir Friday? - Wow, that's actually better.
- Yup.
It's all yours.
So come let me in the mainframe.
Is this about your operations account? - No.
Cyril - Yeah? I'm on a top-secret mole hunt.
Oh, yeah, Pam mentioned that.
- Wha? When? - Well, she called a minute ago.
- You know how Pam loves to gossip.
- Yeah.
I need rug marbles.
I know.
- Come let me into the mainframe.
- Okay.
- I need to confirm this with your mother.
- No.
No.
I mean, what? Cyril.
- What if she is the mole? Think about it.
- Your own mother.
Think what that would do to me if we had to kill her - Archer.
by stabbing her wrinkly neck with a knife? - Yeah.
I can't let you in there.
Can't or won't? - Either? - And after I gave you Stir Friday.
- That is much better.
- I know.
- But if you wanna access the mainframe - What? I guess you'd have to break in.
Break in to the ISIS mainframe.
Which is obviously ludicrous.
As is this baby corn.
What is that about? Archer? ISIS headquarters makes Fort Knox look like a gingerbread house.
Only two means of ingress.
The first, at street level.
Impenetrable after 6.
The second, through an access door on the roof.
Inexplicably unprotected.
But even if you zip-lined across reached the access door and somehow made it into ISIS headquarters you'd still have to find the mainframe.
But, wait, it gets worse.
Inside, there are three countermeasure systems.
The first is pressure sensitive in the floor.
Even a mouse triggers it.
The second is sound sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.
And the third system is state-of-the-art voice activation.
Cyril Figgis.
So, obviously, it would be a lot easier for me if you just disabled all that when you left work tonight somehow.
- Ooh.
That would make me uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
Oh, God, everything makes you uncomfortable.
Just the tip? Just the tip.
Just the tip.
How was I to know you're lactose intolerant? Because I kept screaming it.
- Well, what? - And this I'm just a secretary.
- I don't have access to security whatevers.
- What? - Then get them from Cyril.
- How would I do that? - Seduce him or Pam, or both.
- I can't do that.
- Can't or won't? - Either.
That's how you wanna play it? Fine.
- Are you gonna pay for your lunch? - Just the tip.
Actually, I don't have any cash.
Can you get it? Sorry.
I also need cab fare.
Oh, ugly duckling.
Bock, bock.
So thanks for nothing, Carol.
Now I have to break into ISIS headquarters in a $900 turtleneck.
And if it gets ruined I'm gonna make you drink heavy cream, you Carol.
Wow, that was actually pretty easy.
Thanks, new turtleneck.
Oh, and thank you, duffel bag.
Jesus, what else could go wrong? Exactly.
You're not Archer.
That's what's so great about you.
And the fact your mother died in a fire.
- What? - I said where are we on that stir-fry? Agent Kane.
What? Yes, confirmed.
Confirmed a naughty nellie's breaking our after-work phone rule.
- Cyril, there's been a break-in at ISIS.
- What? - Think it's the mole? - God, you and Pam - Pam's all right.
- Wow.
Okay.
I've got to go.
- But it's Stir Friday.
- Hurray.
- But if I'm not here - Yeah.
Because after three months of whatever it is we're doing it's weird that you can't leave me alone in your apartment.
- I know I have trust issues, all right? - But it's - It's Archer's fault I'm like this.
- Here we go.
- All of those years of lying and cheating.
- It's fine.
That thing with the mayonnaise.
- How messed up he is about his mother.
- Fine.
Do you know he called out her name once when we f? Fine! - And here we are.
All fine.
- Cyril, come on, hon, please? Now who's a naughty nellie? - Hello? Hi, who's this? Cyril Figgis.
I'm sorry.
Did you say Faggis? - Figgis.
Figgis.
- Who is it? Better not be Pam.
Not Faggis? - Figgis.
I was very clear.
Hi, I'm a huge fan of cock and my name is Cyril Figgis.
Holy shit.
Our security is atrocious.
Seriously, it's really bad.
Password.
Hm.
Password.
How about "guest"? No way.
It can't be.
Jesus Christ, that is just Baby Town frolics.
Okay, operations account.
Just how deep in the red am I? Out of my mind.
Oh, no.
How? How did I spend that much money? Yeah, I know it's sexy, Woodhouse.
That's why I bought 10.
Now arrange those by color.
These are all black.
Oh, are they? Or are five in a dark black and five in a slightly darker black? And now I'm short a slightly darker black one.
So let's just put all my expenses into some pathetic idiot's account by the name of Oh, Krenshaw.
- Oh.
Now that's not very nice.
- Oh, God.
Hey, I was I was just talking about you.
And about how this isn't what it looks like.
- A lot of that going around.
- Yeah.
It's an epidemic.
For example, my real name is Kremenski.
- Is that sound? Is that Jewish? - It's Russian.
Um - Russian-Jewish? - I'm the mole, idiot.
What? I made up the mole.
Yes, but you told Pam and now everyone is looking for a real mole.
God, do we hate Pam.
- So I have to escape.
- And irony.
Thanks for breaking into the mainframe for me.
- Double irony.
- I'll need 50,000 for travel expenses.
- Fifty thousand? - From your account.
- That's too much.
- It's all last-minute bookings for two.
Wha? Oh.
Because when I hand the notorious Duchess to the KGB I won't just get a promotion, I'll get my own dacha.
- Too bad you'll never see it.
- What the? Lana, Krenshaw's a mole.
And his name's not really Krenshaw, it's Kremenski.
Definitely Russian, possibly a Jew.
I don't know.
Thoughts? Yeah.
Shut up.
And you, drop it.
- Or what? - No, no, no.
Do not wind her up.
That is a big gun, and she is baby crazy.
- Baby crazy? - That's why I dumped her.
- You little You sack of shit.
- What? What? I dumped you because you're dragging around a 35-year-old umbilical cord.
See? All you talk about is baby shit because you're baby crazy.
- You wanna see crazy? - No, I've seen that movie and spoiler alert, it ends with a closetful of my suits on fire.
- I wish you'd been wearing one.
- Who would want to wear an on-fire suit? - Cosplay enthusiasts.
- What? Do you even hear how totally batshit insane you sound? I'll tell you what I hear.
Yeah, please keep talking.
So why are you sitting here in the car eating stir-fry? Oh, it's Stir Friday.
And Lana said to.
Krenshaw? - Ms.
Archer? - What's this flap about a break-in? - Mother, look out.
Krenshaw is a mole.
Oh, Pam's just full of crap as she is of carbohydrates.
- Now Hey.
- Not this time, you impossible bitch.
Also, you should all be nicer to Pam.
- I am always nice to her.
- To her face.
- Why aren't you in the car? - Will somebody do something? What are you doing, you idiot? Shut up.
It's classic misdirection.
Looks like we've got a Mexican standoff, Kremenski.
How is this a Mexican standoff? - Dumb-ass.
I don't care if you shoot her.
- I do.
- But what if I shoot her, mama's boy? Sterling? - Yes.
- Picture her dead in the gutter - Sterling.
and what your pathetic life will be like without old Mommy dearest.
Jesus Christ.
What is it? - He's got an erection.
What? - What the hell is wrong with you people? Nothing.
You, on the other hand Ow.
Ow.
- An erection? - Ow.
Hey.
What's in there, buckles? The thought of me dead gives you an erection? No, just half of one.
The other half would have really missed you.
I mean, not - Oh.
- Ugh.
Johnny Bench called.
Yep.
See here, Krenshaw just stole 50,000 from Archer's account.
- Must have been doing it all along.
- Apology accepted, ass douche.
- What? Call him that again - Make me.
What? - Do you see this? - I just don't understand.
- This is a hostile work environment.
- I would have known if we had a mole.
- How? - How what, dear? - How could you know if we had a mole? - Um Then I am taking hot pepper and slowly I am rubbing it around Goddamn it.
Hello? Darling? - Who was this? - Who are you, Comrade Question? And who are you, Comrade Questions? - Comrade? - Oh, shut up.
You and your erection.
- And why are there doughnuts everywhere? - Lana did that.
Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants.
Malory Archer.
Ho.
You get more beautiful every time I see you.
- Oh-ho-ho, Gussy.
- Minx.
You'll be the death of me yet.
But if I die let it be with the name of this dusky jewel upon my lips.
Lord Feltchley, may I present Miss Lana Kane? Yes, you bloody well may.
So nice to, uh Wow.
Okay, that's kidskin you're slobbering on, so Okay.
Wouldn't want to offend that boyfriend of yours, eh, wot? No offense taken, Your Lordship.
Glad to hear it.
Whoever you are.
Cyril Figgis, ISIS Comptroller.
- And also my - Boyfriend.
- Person I'm dating.
- No, he isn't.
- We date.
- No, you don't.
- Ha.
- No, no, no.
Your man's a rakish chap.
Air of mystery, chiseled good looks? - Oh, I think maybe you mean my ex? - Oh.
- Archer.
- Archer, exactly just.
And if memory serves, not only handsome, but also A secret agent.
That's what I am.
And I shouldn't even be saying that but you have a certain thickness about you that I very find appealing I find your drunkenness very unappealing I am drunk or I wouldn't be talking to you.
- So if you'll please excuse me.
- Hey, come on.
Don't be like that.
- Whoops.
- Sterling, look out.
Feltchley, you dirty Sassenach.
Free Irishmen will never bow down before the English crown.
Oh là là, Sterling Archer.
That was totally ninja.
Yeah, if you're into that.
Hmm? - Lana? - Hon? Hello? - Huh? Hey.
- What's up, buddy? - Ugh.
Nothing.
Oh, dear.
Good show, Archer.
Really saved my bacon there.
Hey, come on.
You know I'd never let anything happen to your bacon.
- I love you, Santa Claus.
- What? I do.
Cyril, we've got big problems.
Well, it may seem daunting now but in the long run the HSA makes a lot more sense than flex accounts.
I don't mean the health plan.
Unless it covers Wandering Eye Syndrome.
That depends on if that's a real thing.
Oh, it's very real.
And Lana has it.
- Wait, what? - Cyril, I know you saw how she looked at Sterling last night.
Well, I think she was just shaken up Stirred up, Cyril.
- In the loins.
- You think her loins were stirring? - Lf not frothing.
- Frothing? Great.
What should I do? We should make you into someone for whom Lana's loins get equally frothy.
And how exactly would we do that? She's obviously attracted to men of danger.
- Like Archer.
- Exactly.
- The perfect field agent.
- Who better to train you to become one? Archer train me? To be a field agent? He's already been briefed.
But only on the "what," mind you, not the "why.
" No sense telling him it's about Lana - Boy, wait till I tell her.
- No.
Cyril.
Under no circumstance is Lana to know about our little plan.
- Right.
I think.
Oh.
- But about plans: Health plan switchover? - Cyril.
I'll take care of whatever that is.
You just concentrate on your training.
- And Archer's really okay with this? - Oh, not at all.
Which is just gravy.
No, I just let mother think that because I know what she's up to vis-à-vis Cyril and Lana and me.
And it's not broadening Cyril's horizons.
Trust me, Mother's idea of horizon-broadening is a lot of fights walking home from a lot of jazz-tap lessons.
I so enjoy our talks.
You got them? They're loaded and ready to go? Seriously, Krieger, you are my Oprah.
So obviously I'm not happy about this whole arrangement, but But your mother is, so But I wonder what Lana thinks? Oh, Lana's not need-to-know on this.
Wow, "open purse, remove balls" huh? I'm sure it's not the first time you kept a secret from Lana.
Uh Hello.
Herpes? - You gave Lana herpes? Ahem.
- Hello, Cheryl.
- It's Carol.
What? Since when? Since I had it legally changed because you always call me Carol.
Wow, that's - Excuse us.
- Ugh.
Okay, now what is this herpes business? Sorry, bad joke.
And a false alarm.
- Lesson one, get used to that.
- Should I be writing this down? No.
Never leave a paper trail.
That's lesson one.
- So ditch this.
- Hey, that's Ow! Jesus.
- My dead mom's pen.
Cyril did that.
This is what a real field agent uses.
Huh.
Point's a lot finer than I prefer.
- That's because it's a hypodermic needle - What? and the cartridge is full of a deadly super-toxin called Poizocaine.
- Here.
Keep it in here.
- Uh Hey, whoa.
- Wait a minute.
- But be careful.
The cap slips off for, like, no reason.
Beep, beep, beep.
Oh, you giving me the truck noise Karen Carpenter's stunt double? - I thought you were walking backwards.
It's all the HSA switchover crap.
I'm so over that lame flex account.
When does the HSA start? When Cyril e-files these DD-14s.
- Oh, Ms.
Archer's taking care of those.
- What? Cyril's off somewhere with Mr.
Archer.
I'm sorry, Cyril's off what? With whom? I think "somewhere" was the "what" there.
- "Mr.
Archer" was the "whom.
" - Worlds collide, huh? Inevitable for a serial workplace-dater.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Call the kettle black.
- Ugh.
Did she just race-card me, or are you totally just gay for her? I'm the Human Resources Director, Little Miss Hostile Work Environment.
She is riddled with herpes.
Hey.
Inappropriate workplace topic.
And also a dealbreaker.
- Lesson one: Human intel - Oh, shoot.
- I forgot about the DD-14s.
- Screw them.
That's Mother's headache.
You tell me, does it look like I'm allergic? - Jesus Jones, yes.
- So when I asked for cucumber slices which one of you idiots sent up zucchini? - That, well, that would be - That would be Jane who did that.
- Scatterbrain Jane? - I know, she's just a mess.
- Because this is obviously zucchini.
Oh.
You'd recognize a vegetable that wasn't wrapped in a Monte Cristo sandwich.
What's that supposed to mean? That is Pam, isn't it? Okay, so, human intelligence entails? Well, there's false flags, dead-drops, drop-outs, cut-outs active doubles, passive doubles, dangled moles the often under-appreciated honeypot? - Wow.
- One of my favorites.
- That sounds like a lot to cover.
- Yeah, so we may have to gloss over almost all of it, but - Aah! - Weapon.
Oh.
- Oh, hey hon.
- Hey back.
- Hello.
- What's - What's this? - Well, see here's the thing Under no circumstance is Lana to know about our little plan.
- Here's what thing? - Okay.
- Archer's DD-14.
- Yeah.
That we're on our way down to clear up with Jane.
- Really? - Well you know Scatterbrain Jane.
Heh-heh.
- You're cooking dinner later? - Yes, I am.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Speargun? - Oh.
I can't believe I just did that.
- Yeah, dunce.
Now Jane's a loose end.
Hey, Jane.
You getting a snack? Keep your story vague.
That's lesson one.
But, I mean, morality aside, how do you keep track of all these lies? Practice, Cyril.
Lying is, like, 95 percent of what I do.
- In your job.
- Sure.
It was pretty cool how you handled that speargun.
- Yeah, it was pretty cool.
- Will I get to learn karate? Karate? The Dane Cook of martial arts? - No.
ISIS agents use Krav Maga.
- Krav? We've got an ex-Mossad guy, he comes in Thursdays.
- Neat.
- Yeah.
Tuesdays he does a spin class.
- So will I need sweatpants? - Cyril.
You need all new clothes.
What's wrong with these? Sorry.
Oh.
I was laughing at your clothes.
Wow, Archer, you were right.
A tailored suit hangs so much better.
That's because Woodhouse is a genius.
Like so many other geniuses, unappreciated in his life Shut up and hem, you old fruit.
- Speaking of fruit, sir.
- Oh, sorry.
Heh-heh.
- Cyril, check this out.
Watch yourself.
- Really? - Don't make it weird.
It's your friend.
- And so's this baby.
Jeezy Petes.
It's a Chekhov.
Russian-made.
- .
25 caliber.
- When would you use an underwear-gun? Hopefully never.
But say you're in a Caribbean bungalow and you're kind of high.
An exotic woman on the bed now is she just the high-priced whore you asked for? - Or is she an assassin? - I don't know.
I Here's room service.
Who ordered champagne? How should I know.
Exactly.
You're baked, can't remember.
Since when does it take three huge, surly Jamaican guys to deliver one bottle of champagne? Oh.
- Because they're assassins too.
- Or Maybe one guy's a new waiter, the second one's training him and the third's from maintenance, finally off his lazy ass to fix the AC.
Oh.
Yeah, I guess that could happen.
Point is, you come out of the john waving this around nobody's gonna bug you for a tip.
Here.
- It's a gift.
- Thanks, wow, that's slippery.
And the safety's off so be careful, it could go off for, like no reason.
Now what're these pills? Oh, just antihistamines mostly.
You just rest, Ms.
Archer.
We'll take care of these DD-14s for you.
Damn right you will.
Idiot.
Pam, look at this.
- Holy shitsnacks.
- We have snacks? Everybody's personal medical records.
- No, we can't be looking at this.
Are there snacks? It's totally confidential.
It totally should be.
Look at this.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
Cyril tried to get his plan to cover a penis ensmallment? - Who'd have thunk it? - I bet Agent Kane thunks it plenty.
- You bet she does what? - Oh! I bet she, uh Oh.
- I got nothing.
- That's what I thought.
- You seen Cyril? Is that Lana? Wow.
What happened to you? Scatterbrain Jane, but let me just tell you, okay? You should be thankful you have Cyril.
- Well - For about 12 reasons.
Well, thank you, Malory.
But if you don't mind, I'd prefer to keep my personal affairs out of the office.
- Oh, please.
She's had more pens in that company ink than a pen store.
And yet does not have herpes.
- Dealunbreaker.
- Ugh.
What's the matter, baby? Afraid you'll catch something? No, it's not that.
I've just never been this close to a Call girl.
It's not an insult, Cyril.
Trinette takes pride in her work.
- I really do.
- Okay.
- So come on budge in.
- Uhn.
- Gosh, yeah.
- Now that's not so bad, is it? - Ha-ha-ha.
- No.
That feels pretty good.
- I can tell.
You are gifted.
- Okay.
- God, it's just his gun, Trinette.
Sorry.
Bet this seems pretty weird.
Oh, please.
The sick shit I've done in this apartment? - Okay.
- And that wasn't all gun, neither.
Ha-ha.
No, ma'am.
Hey, can you two focus? Please? Woodhouse.
Are you ready, or what? Yes, quite ready sir.
Though not entirely willing.
- Yeah, and I don't know if I am, either - Could have fooled me.
Hey.
- Oh, Trinette.
It's perfectly safe.
You're tangoing then your trained field agent eyes spot two threats.
But they're not trained.
We haven't done this yet.
This is how you train them.
So.
- You spot your first threat.
Woodhouse.
- Ooh.
Hoo.
- My knees aren't - Bam, bam, bam.
You put him down.
But just shoot the pad, not Woodhouse.
- Like, actually shoot the gun? Then.
How else are you gonna learn? Okay, he's down just the pad.
Then you see the second threat.
Oh, no, you're out of ammo.
What are you gonna do? Oh, that's where the turn comes in? Duh.
Woodhouse.
Get in position.
I really need a better health plan.
Shut up.
Weapon is hot and live fire exercise in five, six, seven, eight.
Tango, tango, tango.
Scan the ballroom of the Cuban embassy for the agent you're supposed to meet.
You're just some Canadian dude down here on business and threat.
Woodhouse.
- Yes.
- Cyril.
Shoot.
- Oh, oh.
- Aah! - Shoot, bitch.
Democracy's at stake.
- Oh! Take that, forces of evil.
- Heh.
Ooh.
- Whoa.
- Way to go, baby.
You hit it.
Yeah.
I did, didn't I? - Second threat.
- Oh.
Right, I forgot about - Second threat.
Jesus.
- Ow! Christ on sale.
Jesus.
Yeah, Cyril.
That was totally ninja.
No, Archer.
That was totally uncool.
Sorry, Trinette, did that hurt? Yeah, it fricking hurt, idiot.
It's ice.
- Okay, we'll use grapes.
- We've only lingonberries, sir.
Ballistically similar to grapes? Screw your grapes and screw your whatever-berries, I am out of here.
- No, wait.
Trinette, please, l - Spying ass bastards.
- Please my fat Irish ass.
Ow! - Ooh.
What the hell's in your freaking pocket? Um - Ha.
- Oh.
Oh.
I don't feel so good.
Me neither.
And voicemail again.
Huh.
So, it's me.
Duh.
And did you say you'd cook, or did I mishear that? I know I misheard you about Jane, because turns out, I ran into her.
Hey, Jane.
You getting a tampon? Yeah.
Loose end.
But I'm sure you had a good reason to lie to me so can't wait to hear what it was.
- Oh, my God, you killed a hooker.
- Call girl.
- She was a - No, Cyril.
When they're dead they're just hookers.
God, I said the cap slips off the poison pen for no reason.
I know, but I just assumed that if anything bad happened No.
Do not say the Chekhov gun, Cyril.
That, sir, is a facile argument.
And also woefully esoteric.
- Woodhouse.
- Fetching a rug, sir.
Now he's fetching a rug.
Happy, Cyril? No.
No, I'm not happy.
Well, guess what.
Me neither.
I mean, big picture, I wouldn't say I'm a happy person.
Sir.
I have fetched the rug.
Plus now I'm out a rug.
Oh, God.
I should never have agreed to this.
You and your stupid mother and her stupid frothing loins.
Hey.
I know you're upset, but if you ever mention my mother's loins or their frothiness, to me again I don't know what I'll do, but it will be bad.
Now let's go bury this dead hooker.
Shirt tails.
We need a password.
- Hang on a second.
Ha-ha-ha.
How you doing, Ms.
Archer? I am good.
- Okay, try Okay, try "guest.
" Real good.
Well, that's just idi Oh, my God.
I know, right? So here let's make the co-pay zero, and the deductible - Super high, right? - No, low.
You want the lowest deductible.
But don't you deduct it on your taxes or something? - Wow.
- So you want more? And people think Jane's stupid.
Speaking of, it's probably better if Jane was the last one to log in.
You are a bitch.
I am not.
What? Because I don't want Sterling to end up with a woman like Lana Kane? My God, a black ops field agent? Thought she was going in a whole other direction with that.
Because let me tell you, I was black ops.
And that does not for a young boy a very merry Christmas make.
Ajax a success, Teheran is ours, stop.
Merry X-mas from Mommy and Uncle Kermit, stop.
Also, be nicer to Woodhouse, stop.
- You made up the last part, didn't you? - I did, sir.
Douche.
- Oh, my God.
- I know, right? This is the most kickass health plan ever.
And I think I just had a flashback, so these antihistamines are insane.
Oh, I'm crazy? Cyril, you're the one who killed a perfectly good hooker.
By accident.
We could explain.
To who, Cyril? The cops? Lana? She'd never forgive me.
Archer, my life is ruined.
And all because Mother cooked up this stupid plan - But I just to make you an agent just to impress Lana.
Ironic, isn't it? I'm not sure that's technically irony.
What? This is like O.
Henry and Alanis Morissette had a baby and named it this exact situation.
- No, it's - Yes, it is.
Because a man like you, Cyril, doesn't deserve a woman like Lana.
You You butthole.
You set this all up, just to drive me and Lana apart.
- Well? - Screw you, Archer.
Hey.
Hostile work environment.
Exactly.
And I'm gonna file a hostile work environment lawsuit against you, and your mother, and ISIS, and What? Who the hell is that? - Your confederates in Operation Butthole.
- Cyril.
- Those aren't my confederates.
- Well, nice try but Cyril Figgis ain't buying it.
- You hear that? I ain't buying it.
- Cyril.
Oh, my God.
How about now, Cyril? Are you feeling ready to buy? To Scatterbrain Jane.
And to plan-covered elective surgery.
And the boob job.
That you so need.
And the ass-reduction you so need.
And the skinny-bitch-ectomy you need.
- Oh, my God, did you hear that? - What do you think it is? Immigrants.
That's how they do, you know? Just drive around, listening to raps and shooting all the jobs.
- Then who are those guys? - How should I know? KGB, the Stasi, Shining Path, this guy I know named Popeye? I have enemies, okay? - That's because no one likes you.
- What? Seriously, do you not sense that? I am a product of my upbringing, Cyril.
Well, I was a single mother.
And it's a big dangerous world out there.
Are you idiots still even here? So why aren't you better at this? I am the best at this, Rain Man, okay? I'm like Who? James Bond? Well, I don't like to invite that comparison.
- But yeah, basically.
- So do something.
I'm doing all kinds of stuff, Cyril.
I'm shooting the gun, see? - I'm driving the car.
- I could drive better than that.
So knock yourself out.
I'm ejecting.
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am totally am.
- Stop it.
No.
- No.
- Grenades in the glove box.
- Drive me and the hooker to safety or Excuse me.
- Lana? Yeah, I'm looking for two guys.
They're on their way to the morgue? - Great.
- Archer, what am I gonna tell her? Well, if you learned anything today, it won't be the truth.
I don't care if you have you lied to me.
Did not learn anything.
- Well, you shot a machine gun at me.
- Around you.
- Because my feelings were hurt.
- Well Why on earth would you lie to me? I just wanted to show you I could be a supercool ISIS field agent like Archer, but But baby, don't you know I like you so much because you're exactly the opposite of Archer? - Well, yeah, but - Not to mention your other qualities.
Oh, you are such a naughty Nelly.
- He just gets a pass? Like Milton Berle? Yep.
Hey, so how did you know where I was? When we first started going out I may have injected a tracking device into your body.
In my body? No, no.
Now, that is a breach of trust, Lana.
Do you really wanna open this can of trust-breachy worms right after I caught you and my ex-boyfriend with a hooker in the trunk? - I do not.
- You do not.
Oh, and Archer, how's this for ironic? You know what? I don't have a "one to some other number of douchebags" scale.
So, six? Oh, my God, Trinette.
Yeah, Trinette, you shitass.
- So you know you have to be punished.
- Yes.
You're gonna walk into our video store With the sweet old Korean lady.
- And buy the nastiest, barebackinest, hard dickinest, ball splapiest interracial porno in there.
From the sweet old Korean lady? Yep.
How you feel about that? - Like I got off pretty easy.
- Night ain't over yet.
- Throw me in a trunk? - Not part of the plan.
Inject me with some crazy spy poison? - It was just a harmless tranquilizer.
- You shitass.
I mean, let's be honest, I doubt that's the first needle you ever - Ow! - I never.
Give me your wallet.
I already paid you.
File a customer service complaint.
I'm sure Popeye'd love to hear it.
Hey, come on, you wouldn't tell Popeye.
Oh, watch me.
- Oh.
Give me your watch.
- You know how much this thing costs? Probably less than a new set of kneecaps.
- There.
Happy? - Almost.
You know, I bet there's a lesson to be learned from all this.
But l Oh, shit, my rug.
And if it happens again I'll put a lock on it so no one can enjoy it.
Moving on, item seven.
Oh, I'm afraid I have some tragic news.
- Um, item six wasn't tragic? Zip it.
- Wow.
- Agent Hector Ruíz who had infiltrated El Frente Rojo was killed last night when his cover was blown.
- My little burrito.
- Wait, who? How in the world did his cover get blown? Ruíz? Hey man, talk to these chicks, all right? Tell them how we're really ISIS agents! They don't believe me.
Hello? Señor Wingman? - He probably got careless.
- I'm sure Hector didn't get Oh, come on.
Ruíz was a loose cannon.
He played fast and he played loose.
And in the end, he got burned.
- Be that as it may! - Loose cannon.
For ISIS to continue enjoying Title 6 tax incentives we have to meet certain diversity requirements.
- Oh, I think we're pretty diverse.
- Ha.
Please.
What? You're blackish.
- Ish? - Well, what's the word for it, Lana? - You freaked out when I said "quadroon.
" - Imagine that! - You imagine it! - Both of you, imagine shutting up! Because after losing Agent Pak last year Hey, tell this broad what's up with ISIS, Pak-man.
Wokka, wokka, wokka! and then Agent Mgumbe You going to this lame ISIS picnic? - Loose cannons! the ISIS palette has become decidedly monochromatic.
- I'm one sixty-fourth Cherokee.
- Shut up! - So stupid.
- What? - A, no, you're probably not.
- And B through Z, nobody gives a shit.
- Racist! - What? You're anti-Native American.
- Jeez! - Come on.
Item eight.
We need a diversity hire.
- I vote Asian chick.
- And after an exhaustive search I found the perfect candidate.
So join me in welcoming our new ISIS agent Stern.
Conway Stern.
He's a diversity double-whammy.
So that was the firing range and the cafeteria, and - Do you keep kosher? - Well, I do have a weakness for prawns.
Me too! I'll have them make paella tomorrow.
Okay, that's the mainframe, and these are all just drones.
- Hey, come on! Malory, these are the unsung heroes of ISIS.
Where'd we be without my man Cyril in accounting? Hey, thanks, bro.
You got it, buddy.
Or the lovely Pam in Human Resources.
Yeah, I am kind of lovely.
And last but not least I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
- Me neither.
- See? They don't know anything.
- Now, over here is a big corner office.
I see it's currently empty.
Like my "vagine.
" Yeah, but unlike your dusty "vagine," it's not going to stay empty.
Wait, you don't think you're getting the office.
Well, I am the Human Resources director.
Pam, come on, let's face it.
Your entire job could be done by a - A bulletin board.
- You heard Conway.
I'm essential! How? I can go online and get a list of every federal holiday for the next - Wow, ten thousand years.
- Wait, really? Ten thousand? Hmm? Oh.
No, this isn't even on.
- I'm gonna get that office! I'm getting it, Pam! Oh, my God, I am surrounded by idiots.
And this is the locker room.
Yeah, the, uh, lockers were a tip-off.
Well, I'll leave you to it.
But if you need anything you know how to whistle, don't you, Conway? - Yup, lips together, blow.
Got it.
- Oh.
Ha, ha.
You are just a little treasure.
Jesus, Conway.
- What have you got yourself into, man? - You better pray it wasn't my mother.
I'm fairly confident you misread that whole situation.
- Oh, yeah? - I'm real confident you misread this one.
Uh, how about this one? - This one, uh actually seems kind of gay.
- Maybe because our penises are touching.
Yeah, so, let's go on Three! - What? You, uh, see something you like? - Wha? No, you queer! Oh, I'm queer? From the guy whose tiny gun came with a matching purse? Hey, it's got plenty of stopping power.
What? That little? - Goddamn it, Archer! Again! - Oh, shit.
See that? He was putting on his pants and I stopped him.
So you just watch your step, mister, uh - Damn it.
- There, should have gone with: - "Sammy Gay-vis Junior.
" Damn it! Come on.
She doesn't need a corner office just to Xerox the ISIS newsletter.
- Color Xerox.
And what, you need more room to chop vegetables? All right! Obviously, I need to make a decision.
But which shall it? Oh! Or I could just give Conway both! - You what? - I already took care of those.
Frodo and Salsa were my operations.
At ease, Career Admiral, Malory was getting impatient on Salsa.
- Salsa was a highly complex operation.
- Two phone calls.
- And as for Frodo Wha? Well, some pun involving hobbits.
Like, I bet he wishes he was wearing Bilbo's coat of Dwarven mithril.
- Gonna take your word on that.
- Yeah? Well, take my word on this.
I am the top agent around here.
- So watch it! - So, see, in Middle-earth Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Come on, buddy.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm dead serious.
I wanna file a complaint against Conway.
- On what grounds? - He touched my penis with his penis.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
He just came up to me and was like: "Byoop!" - Where? - All of it.
Head and shaft.
- And Oh, you mean where in the building.
- No.
- That shouldn't matter, Pam.
- I got this other complaint from Brett who said you shot him again.
- Uh here's the thing about Brett.
Oh, shit! Those were the newsletters! Cyril, I need a little favor.
Okay, Carin Oh.
- Now it's Cristal? Cristal.
You know? Like the champagne.
It's what hot black guys drink.
- Uh, you sure about that? - And I want Conway to drink me so I need you to hook a sister up.
- Well, I will certainly try.
Don't try, do.
And here, use this.
Wow, what is this? Tell Conway that his Secret Santa wants to come early.
Or, you know, whoever brings Jewish people their Christmas presents.
What are you doing? - Uh, none of your businessing.
What kind of spy agency scrimps on a freaking shredder? Apparently the kind that scrimps on background checks.
- Who is this guy? - I don't know.
But I got a bad feeling about Mother's little "Project Conway.
" So I must be having a stroke because we actually agree on something.
- Wait, really? Totally.
I mean, he shows up out of nowhere and starts trying to get all up in everything? I mean, Salsa, Frodo.
- Possibly Mother.
- And what do we even know about him? - Only that he's not circumcised.
- Okay.
- Glossing over how you know that - We touched penises.
No! Glossing.
But a non-circumcised Jewish guy, that's not weird to you? No, why would? I mean, I'm not Jewish and I'm circumcised.
So it can - It doesn't work like that.
Lana, come on.
I think we both know it works fine.
Oh, come on.
Not your dick, dumbass.
Oh, my God! This is about you and me, right? - Oh, my God! Get over yourself! - Hey, I am over me.
But apparently you're not.
- What the hell smells like shrimp? - Just my sensual womanhood.
Oh, wait.
Ew.
I bet your womanhood smells divine.
- Conway! - Now, whom can I thank for these shrimps? Me, your secret Jew Santa.
Conway! That was amazing.
Yes, so, uh okay.
- Oh, my God, I hope I'm pregnant.
- What are you talking about? The system bounced your sexual harassment complaint against Conway.
- Well, unbounce it back.
- Who am I, Tron? Talk to your mother, she bounced it.
- Why? - Hey.
Whoa.
- Why would she do that? - Don't go starting rumors about Conway boning your mother.
- Oh, my - You get any of that in the trash can? - No.
I, uh, missed it on purpose.
- Hey, Malory, uh, you got a second? - I sincerely doubt it.
- It's about Conway.
- Then yes, I have entire minutes.
Isn't he just a dream come true? Well, that's the thing.
How did you actually find Conway? Well, he just sort of appeared.
- Uh, yes, okay.
- Like a foundling, carved out of onyx.
Yes, but from where? I mean, if you didn't do a background check Are you an idiot? Or do you just think I am? - He totally checked out.
- Okay, so do you mind if I take a little? Lana Kane! Just because now you're not the only black agent - Hey, that is not - Urban.
Whatever.
You come in here and accuse Conway of what, exactly? Okay, fine, I can't prove anything right now.
But that never stopped J.
Edna Hoover from persecuting Martin Luther King now, did it? - What does that have to do? Wait, J.
Edna? You never heard that? How Hoover was this huge, cross-dressing chicken hawk? - I had not.
- That's exactly the kind of slanderous and unsubstantiated rumor I will not tolerate at ISIS.
- Think about that while on suspension.
- While I'm on what? - What are you, deaf and racist? - Wha? - I'm black.
- Oh, put it back in the deck.
- Hey, how is my lovely lady.
- Suspended.
- What? - Malory suspended me.
Just because I had the nerve to ask questions about her little homeboy McJewerson.
- Whoa, Lana, honey.
- What? - Even though it's perfectly natural for you to be jealous of Conway Then she cold-cocked you, huh? - Yeah, with that big Flintstoney fist of hers.
- Seriously, "Homeboy McJewerson"? - Oh, come on, I've heard worse than that.
Yeah, but it doesn't even make sense.
- I mean, maybe if you were Scottish or - Hey, man, racism, anti-Semitism.
You can't go looking for logic in it.
Here, this'll help the swelling.
Oh, thank you.
Ha, ha.
Where'd you get the steak? Cristal.
Yet another offering of unrefrigerated meat and/or seafood.
- Yeah, she's kind of weird that way.
- She's kind of weird a bunch of ways.
What you doing, Birdbones? - Looking for a pregnancy test online.
- But there's a drugstore half a Oh.
You mean that you take online.
- Yeah I want to know like, now.
- Well, thank God for them internets.
- Okay, what is this lame meeting about? - No idea, I'm busy and go away.
- Excuse me? - Oh, my God, why are you still here? - Mother called me for a meeting.
- But I thought you called a meeting.
Oh, and by the way, you don't call a meeting, only I call a meeting.
I called the meeting.
- Which I love.
That you did that.
I know it's not standard procedure but we've got a problem.
- A problem or a blessing? A problem.
It's a silent submarine propulsion system, called the Whisper Drive.
- Oh, sounds sexy.
- Would you stop it.
- Folks, please.
- Embarrassing.
- You are embarrassing.
- Jesus.
This is Wilhelm Schmeck, inventor of the Whisper Drive.
Schmeck went missing along with the plans for the Whisper Drive.
I tracked him to South Beach.
He's arranged to sell the plans to Cuban Naval Intelligence.
If that happens undetectable Cuban missile subs could be parked right off Miami Beach.
Ugh.
Just what Miami needs.
More Cubans.
And all we need is a stand-in, who resembles Schmeck's Cuban contact Wha? What? That looks nothing like me.
- Well, he's just a lot more handsome.
- Whatever.
Zip it! Conway, dear? - The plan? - Using Archer as bait we slip in just ahead of the real Cubans, capture Schmeck, and recover the plans.
If we could run this thing through your condo, that - You have a South Beach condo? - I, uh Oh, hey, how's the, uh, lemon tree doing? RaúI says it already has tiny lemons.
That was a wonderful thank-you gift.
- Well, it was a wonderful weekend.
- It was, wasn't it? You were there, in the condo, together? - Yeah, last weekend.
Oh, my God.
Oh, for See? That's what happens when you drink all day and skip lunch.
Oh, we were supposed to have paella.
Archer, come on, man, let's go.
You go! Get on the plane, buckle in, sit there and think about how you're not the boss of me.
Hey, babe.
Got any extra puke bags? Why? You taking a moral inventory? Jesus, God, what are you doing here? - I'm, trying to save - A relationship? Lana, maybe when I get back, we can work out some kind of bang-buddy deal, but Ow! - I want you to listen to me.
- Well then unperforate my eardrum.
Un head up your ass! I think Conway is totally up to something.
Duh! You think I'm an idiot? I know he wants to marry Mother and cut me out of the will.
- Ugh.
Archer.
- Which is why I'm going to kill him.
- Oh.
Okay, well, whatever the reason.
It's not because of the whole black stepfather thing.
- You know me better than that.
- Yeah, I do.
So try not to do anything stupid, okay? Conway could be dangerous.
Yeah.
You know what's dangerous? - Your obsession with me.
- Just Seriously Lana, call Kenny Loggins because you're in the Danger Zone.
- From Top Gun.
- Just be careful.
No.
God, this is so classic Mother.
Yeah, it's pretty tastefully done, huh? No, you ass.
The selfishness.
She never shares anything with anybody.
You're keeping that office for you? I need it to escape the glare from those windows across the street.
From the? There's no glare.
Well, not now.
But mid-April? Every morning.
For almost 20 minutes.
So you're gonna keep that huge corner office empty the other - Ninety-gazillion percent of the time.
- Just because the glare is annoying? Well, semi-annoying.
Okay, you're meeting Schmeck at that café across the street.
- And, uh, why do you have that? Exactly? - You never know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, two people all alone together, down here in South Beach.
I'd rather have it and not need it - Uh-huh.
Than need it and not have it.
- Ah.
Uh-huh.
Kind of like a condom.
Which happened last weekend.
- Oh, my! Ugh! - Damn, man, I was kidding! - Look, if you're too nervous - I'm fine, all right? Just let me rinse off my mustache.
You are more handsome in your photos.
Oh, yeah, talk to me about handsome.
And you have no trace of Cuban accent.
Yeah, it's called tradecraft, genius.
- I blend.
- Just shut up and get the plans.
- You shut up and get the plans.
- What? I mean, give me those plans now.
Give me those plans.
You may have them once I confirm the balance in my Swiss account.
- Tell him not to bother.
- What? Wait, what are we doing? - Conway! What the shit, man? - What? Schmeck was a traitor.
Yeah, now he's all over my 400 dollar custom shirt.
I'll buy you a new one.
Now grab the plans before it's too late.
- It's already too late.
- Ha, ha! Yes it is, now hand over Because it's already soaked into the fibers, dumbass.
This is linen! And that is a Cuban hit squad.
And you might want to duck.
Oh, my God.
Conway! - That was amazing! - Yeah, well, you know.
No, seriously, that was like - That was like, uh - A Charles Whitman Sampler? Damn it, yes.
Seriously, thanks.
Oh, don't thank me yet.
What, Conway? No! - Now you can thank me.
- Oh, my God.
You saved my life twice.
You'd have done the same for me.
- No, I wouldn't have.
- Ha, ha.
I was actually kind of planning to kill you.
- Wait, what? - I know, now I'm totally embarrassed.
Hey, you know what? Water under the bridge, dude.
- Come over here, let's man-hug it.
- All right.
Okay.
Um I mean, after all we are going to be family.
Once I marry your Mom.
- What? - I'm kidding.
God, relax, man.
Because for a second there, I was like I mean, not in a racist way, but - Conway? - Yeah, buddy.
- Uh, are there more bad guys behind me? - Nope.
You dick.
You dumbass.
I set this whole thing up.
I just needed a stand-in for those broke-ass Cubans.
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean, come on! The Chinese'll pay five times as much for the Whisper Drive.
And once they do? Let's just say you better learn to use some chopsticks, buddy.
Conway, wait.
Just answer me one question.
Yeah, make it quick.
My ride is here.
- And your lungs are filling up with blood.
- Did you have sex with my mother? Wait, what? That is your only question? Not who am I, not how did I infiltrate ISIS or who the hell is flying the helicopter? - Just answer the question! No, Archer, I didn't have sex with your mom.
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, and that? That would have been a though image to get out of my head.
That, right there? That kind of racism is exactly why I can't wait to see tiny little Chinese boots on your white-ass necks.
Which may sound hypocritical, I know, but Would you go? - Aah! What the? - Sorry, Conway.
- Oh, wait, shit, I had something for this.
- Aah.
Is it something like, uh, "You don't get off the hook that easy"? - Damn it.
- Yeah, he's good at those.
- Well, crawl on over there and blow him.
- Hey, come on.
- Now, drop the case, Conway! - It's cuffed on, woman.
Aah! And how the hell are your hands that freaking strong? Ew.
You haven't seen the last of Conway Stern! Which is not my real name! Uh, so let me guess.
- Yeah.
Whoever he is, he ghosted an ID file onto our worldwide database.
Yeah.
Which you probably found while researching me.
Lana, because you're in the, uh Danger Zone.
And those were his last words.
Right before he bled to death on the rug.
Which rug? Oh, good.
I thought you meant in the bedroom.
No, that one is just jute.
Exactly.
Guests come in from the beach, they're all sandy or whatever, and Suspension? Lana, dear, you are getting a bonus.
My God! You foiled that perfidious Conway, saved Sterling's All right, just pull the knife out.
And then slap Saran Wrap on the hole.
Oh! But leave me enough to make guacamole.
No, you squeeze lemon juice over it, then smush the Saran Wrap right down on top.
That way it doesn't go brown.
Oh, let the paramedics do that.
You just have fun, dear.
Mm-hm.
Bye.
Oh, damn.
Now I bet she's going to squeeze up all my brand new lemons.
And I'll have nothing left to remind me of Conway.
- Except his little mocha love child.
- His what? Yeah.
- You had sex with Conway? Yeah, and he totally impregnated me.
Wait, he was only here two days.
How is that pregnancy test showing positive? Oh, this is just a detergent pen.
I just put a little blue sticker on it.
 Torvald Utne.
The Olympic shot-putter? The chairman of the UN Intelligence Committee.
Do you not even skim the briefings in your inbox? - I have an inbox? - Utne decides which spy agency gets the insanely lucrative UN contract.
And as you may or - probably don't know, for six years running the contract has gone to ODIN.
Ugh.
The Organization of Douche bags In In - Wait, I had something.
- Douche-baggery notwithstanding - Nowheresville.
their ground floor isn't a laundromat.
- Wash-and-fold, technically.
- ISIS needs that UN contract.
So I am going to woo Mr.
Torvald Utne - Gross.
with a dinner party.
Tonight.
- And you're uninviting me in advance.
- Normally, yes.
But this party is different.
And very important so absolutely nothing can go wrong.
Then we better keep Dr.
Bellows away from Jeannie - No, no dates.
- I Dream of Jeannie.
No one is bringing a date, so don't you bring a date.
I don't wanna get there and be the only one without a date.
And I don't want another one of your sullen whores using my medicine cabinet like a Pez dispenser.
Peggy, you will probably kill me for this but Senator, we now have a subway museum If Are you still big into trains? That wasn't her fault.
Who puts OxyContin in a Xanax bottle? - People with servants, idiot.
- Lf they steal pills how does it help to switch the labels? - Because they can't read English.
Ha, ha.
I'm gonna leave you to think about that whole line of reasoning - You think.
- And what scheme you're hatching for this dinner party.
- There's no scheme-hatchery.
Hello? - Do you mind? It's the caterer.
Right.
Okay, sure.
Your instructions are clear? - Ja.
No problem.
Oh, I have other call.
Yeah, okay.
- Hello? Oh.
Hello? - Da, da.
- So your instructions are clear? - Da.
- Excellent.
- Uta, get dressed, we work tonight.
But Mani, what about The Fantasticks? Tomorrow, liebchen, I promise, but to - You brought this ridiculous thing.
- Is it so ridiculous to ready my body for the baby? - Uta.
Please do not start this.
Just ready your body for work, hmm? Fine.
What is the job? Two jobs.
The first, we make a big phony attempt to kill Torvald Utne.
- Okay.
And the second? We kill Torvald Utne.
So your instructions are clear? Drinks and fish balls.
You ring first bell for dinner.
And on second bell, I come out, all John Wooey screaming crazy and shooting blanks.
Then I throw myself in front of Utne, shielding him with my supple body as you're gunned down by ISIS agents.
Who are also shooting blanks.
Mm-hm.
- And loud ones.
Because for Utne to buy it, everyone must act surprised.
- Oh, I'm sure they will.
- Yeah, me too.
Mani, I have a bad feeling for this.
Why? Only I will have real bullets.
This is taking chocolate from a baby.
Oh, no, we won't give our baby chocolate.
- Ugh.
- He can have carob.
Thanks for inviting us to your swanky dinner party, Ms.
Archer.
- Yeah, I could get used to this.
- Don't.
You're only here because I may need you to take one for the team.
- Torvald is an incorrigible poon hound.
Ha, ha.
- Those are enormous in size.
Oh, well - Uh, thank you.
Kind of.
- May I please cup one in my hand? - Ooh.
See, here's the thing - We're actually together.
Cyril, go get some gravlax.
Torvald, feel free to cup anything in the room.
Uh Oh, you were talking about my guns.
Strange that you wear them to a party.
- Normally I wouldn't, but Malory - But that's ISIS for you.
Always primed and ready for action.
This is good to know.
- Yeah, how about that? Which is why you should consider ISIS for the UN contract.
Our agents are highly-trained in many disciplines.
- Like Krav Maga, for instance.
- My arm, my arm.
- You're breaking my arm.
- Lana.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that hurt? - Yes, it hurt.
What is wrong with you? Nothing but too much enthusiasm for the opportunity to serve the UN.
- Oh, and hands like the Truckasaurus.
- Hey.
- Gravlax, anyone? - No.
No gravlax.
I need painkillers.
- Cyril, in my medicine cabinet Wait, no.
- Aah.
I have to get it myself, just right after I get that.
- Hello.
- You're late.
- What is that smell? - Gravlax and failure.
I think Lana just broke Torvald's hand.
- Truckasaurus.
Ha, ha! - And we won't win that contract if Who on God's green earth dressed you? Nobody, that's why I'm late.
Woodhouse just disappeared.
Only temporarily, sir.
Why are you here? - Actually sir, I'm with Carina.
- Who? - Carina.
- Ugh.
- I changed it again.
I feel that Carina better captures my sensual womanhood.
Yeah, she so totally does.
- You said no dates.
- I said no such thing.
- Well, your mouth did.
- Well, your mouth better get over there and make Torvald happy.
- Um, phrasing? Regale him with exciting tales of ISIS exploits.
Take his mind off Lana's huge, Johnny Benchian fingers.
- Can we get off my fingers? - Yeah, they are pretty big.
- First time I've heard you complain.
- Hi-ho! Ha, ha.
- Seriously, who wants gravlax? - Sterling, go.
Regale him.
- I think he's already being regaled.
Meatballs! - Oh, for Torvald.
- Bet you get that a lot, huh, Torvie? Swedish meatballs.
Get away from me, you disgusting woman.
- Wow.
So even Pam got a date.
- A man, even.
But suave master-spy, Sterling Archer, stands alone.
Just like the cheese.
- I have a - And a very handsome cheese, at that.
I don't even know how you got out, Woodhouse.
- Alone.
- And I do have a date.
- You do? Where is she? - She is parking.
Oh, yeah? What's she driving? A Snuffleupagus? Uh, oh, wait.
Uh, with all that sexy European lingerie modeling Mm-hm? to pay for her European med school that she's going to she probably never had time to learn to drive.
She sounds fabulous.
- Gravlax? - Thanks, no.
I'm allergic to cat piss.
Go away.
So your instructions are clear? - Oh.
Why must you micromanage everything? Yeah, yeah, okay.
You know what second-hand smoke does to a fetus.
Uta, after we kill Utne we need to have a very long and serious talk.
No.
I need a painkiller, not a - Torvald.
- What is that? A calcium supplement? - Trust me, dear, these work wonders.
- Okay.
But what I have seen ISIS is a distant second to ODIN.
Very distant.
What about the groundbreaking work Dr.
Krieger is doing for ISIS in our Applied Research Division? - Yeah, tell him about the sex-robot.
- The what? - Yes The what? - I call him Fister Roboto.
- But it doesn't just fist.
Tell him.
- Pam! He's a fully-integrated multi-fetish artificial being.
- That is the most disgusting - Shut up.
Shut, shut.
And the best part is that he's learning.
- ISIS clearly is not the agency for us.
Rotten gravlax, sex-bots, and, uh except for the Negress, the women are Willing to do whatever it takes.
- Still gross.
- And such rudeness.
- Fister Roboto wouldn't take that.
- He's just too damn sensitive.
As also am I.
So if you will excuse There, there.
Let that calcium citrate seep into your bones.
What about Trinette? She said that? How about Jade? Oh, no, never mind.
Destiny? No, she's not passable.
With that Adam's apple she looks like she swallowed a Rubik's Cube.
Excuse me, sir.
- L - You are looking for a date? - Are you working? Mm.
You could say that, yes.
Then we need to lock down your cover story.
And, uh I need to hit an ATM.
Torvald, please, don't go yet.
- You haven't even tried the fish balls.
- No need.
There is plenty of fishiness going on at ISIS without your balls.
Maybe I should go say something.
Where's the damn fish balls, already? I could kill for some food.
- Sure it wouldn't be the first time.
- Lana.
No, I just meant like she literally killed somebody.
Then ate their corpse.
I saw where you were going.
- You know - When I served in the King's African Rifles the local Zambezi tribesmen called human flesh "long pig.
" Never much cared for it.
Torvald, at least stay for dinner.
- I think you'll be very surprised by - I detest surprises.
Which is why the contract will remain with ODIN.
Mani, do something.
Utne is leaving.
Okay, okay, we go ahead of schedule.
Find some Tupperware, we take food to go.
But you promised me Ruby Foo's.
Yeah, I also promised you a baby.
How's that working out for you? - Hey, does that cook seem weird? - Normal-weird or German-weird? Now, good night, and good Evening, you beautiful girl.
- Hello.
- You're not, um, leaving, are you? No, not if you are staying, Miss? - Oh, um Yup.
- Hübsch.
- Elke Hübsch.
- A pleasure, my dear.
- I am Torvald - Utne, I know.
- I am a great admirer.
- You know he's not the shot-putter, right? Of course he is not the shot-putter.
But I am sure he is very strong.
Ha, ha.
Unlike these drinks.
Come, my dear let us find something potable.
- Whoa.
Wait a minute.
Hey, Utne.
Utne! - Would you shut up? We just need to keep Torvald happy until dinner.
- And what about my happiness, Mother? - Well? - Oh, was that not rhetorical? The Needle? Why is she here? Oh, that Russian prick.
He sent two teams again.
And if the Needle kills Utne, we won't even get our per diem.
But what if you kill them both? Oh.
Yeah, I could do this.
Hey, help.
- Ah! Help with what, sir? No, I was addressing you as "help.
" What's the story on those fish balls? - Coming right out.
- Hurry it up.
All I've had today is, like six gummy bears and some Scotch.
- This is why I don't get you nice things.
- Not that.
Him.
Uta, that was Duchess.
- That was Duchess? - Yeah, the deadliest agent there is.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe they fell for that.
But if he's on the plan of Frau Archer What if her plan is a big fat set-up? What if they mean to kill us? - Oh! Mani, the baby.
- Ah.
Okay.
So now we go to Plan Manfred.
- And then Ruby Foo's.
- Well, we will see.
Really? A European lingerie model.
Only to pay for European med school.
Ha, ha.
- Like to get a physical from her.
- Or with her.
Ha, ha.
- Ow, ow, ow! - I wonder if Dr.
Panty Model knows how many pounds it takes to snap a collarbone? - She probably uses the metric system.
- Yeah, what do they use? Kilowatts? - No, in this case it would be pascals.
- Ugh.
Hey, Europe, be gayer.
- Lana.
Release him.
- As you wish.
- I find your lack of faith disturbing.
- I find your mannish hands disturbing.
I think they're kinda sexy.
- Excuse me? - They're fingers, Pam, not kielbasas.
But keep them limbered up.
I have a big surprise planned for dinner and I need you ready, locked, and loaded.
Yeah so, do you maybe want to let us in on your little scheme-hatchery? - No.
- Oh, if I were 20 years younger.
- I can make you feel like you are.
- Mm.
I would like I think that very much.
- Well then go find an ATM, - I'm sorry? Oh, me too.
I must leave for a moment.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, sorry, don't mind me.
- Hey, are you having a good time? - Oh, I am.
Ha, ha.
Good to hear.
Please excuse us.
Mm-hm.
Keep her out of the medicine cabinet.
One more dead body in here, and that bitch Trudy Beekman will have me right back in front of the co-op board.
You don't get along with your neighbors anywhere.
Who could with a woman who wallpapered her guest bathroom with vintage New Yorker covers? Yes, Major.
I am in position and ready to eliminate the target.
Excellent.
ODIN will find it much harder to bribe a dead man for the UN contract.
And I will find it much more enjoyable to work with the woman who runs ISIS.
- What do you mean "with?" - Against.
Obviously.
Duh.
Obviously.
And so I still think you should let me kill everybody here.
Nyet.
Under no circumstances are you to harm the hostess.
Who, um - Whose name I have no way of knowing.
Hey.
What the hell are you doing? - Uh, Botox.
- Not from the medicine cabinet.
No.
Don't use this.
She switches all the labels on her medicine.
- Why? - I think there's, like, a racial component.
But for all we know, this could be insulin.
- Oh, your mother is a diabetic? - How should I know? Why don't you just pour it on everybody's? Because our employer was very clear: We are not to harm the hostess.
But her I want to poison most of all.
- Are you lazy Huns ready, or what? Oh.
Ha, ha.
Hello, yep.
- Good.
So on the second bell - I come out shooting blanks.
See? Uta is just, uh, polishing the gun.
Give me that.
Some idiot dropped a fish ball on my Azerbaijani rug.
- I am that idiot.
- Ach.
Why are you so immature? I'm 19.
Elke? Is everything all right? Wunderbar, Tovald.
- How are you? - I am fantastic, my dear.
Those calcium supplements are amazing.
You're gonna need some calcium, after I do something bad to your bones.
Hello? - Hello? - Can you hear me? Come in.
- What? Wait.
- What the hell? - What is the frequency? Kenneth? - Turn off.
Turn off.
Turn off.
What? I can't hear you, tiny man.
Oh, great.
Thanks, Mother, for replacing the baby aspirin with LSD.
God, that is just hmm, classic her.
Places, everyone.
- Is everyone comfy? Relatively.
Sterling and Lana? You both have a clear line of sight to the kitchen? - Yes? - Sure, I think so.
- Well then let's eat.
First bell.
- Wow.
Forgot how much I hated that.
- Oh, that's right.
I kept it on the nightstand to wake Nanny whenever Sterling wet the bed.
Ha-ha-ha! - L Mother! Sissy bed-wetter.
- Wait, whose bed? - It was always "don't ask, don't tell.
" Woodhouse.
What are you doing? - Uh, sitting down, sir.
- What, at the table? Like people? Sterling.
- Sterling.
- What? Look, he thinks he's people.
This Archer is a gigantic douche bag.
Oh, Torvald.
- Who cares about him? - Oh.
Woodhouse, dear, please have a seat.
- Very kind of you, ma'am.
Shut up.
- Torvald, a toast? - Sure, go crazy.
- Oh Then, um - Hooray.
Dig in.
Wow.
- And what is this we're eating? - It smells vaguely poisonous.
It does smell vaguely poisonous.
- Are you sure she has the right plate? - Pretty sure.
- Oh, Uta.
- What? I am pretty sure.
Don't worry, this is a normal smell.
- This is called Janssons frestelse.
- Frestel? Yes, frestelse.
It means "temptation.
" Oh, Torvald.
I am very tempted.
Yes, and I am tempted to give ISIS the UN contract, Malory.
Hmm? I mean, you are? - Well, it depends on your frestelse.
Mm.
Tell me, my dear, is it tempting? Elke, what is the matter? Are you? Um - What? That's the wrong plate, Uta.
Uta.
That's how you talk.
- Perfidy.
- No, Torvald, there's no perfidy.
- You poison my food over a contract? - Torvald, I swear I didn't When I am finished with ISIS, you won't be able to get a contract for a pre-paid mobile phone.
- No, no! I will tear you down brick by perfidious brick.
- It's okay.
- Aah! It's okay, they're just blanks.
- Oh.
- Well, see, you say that.
- But they were blanks.
Weren't they? - Uh, only if the back of his skull picked that exact moment to explode outwards.
- What? Ugh! - Oh, my God.
- Damn it.
Where are those Germans? What? I should not do this in my condition.
What condition? Your only condition is that you are a stupid crazy girl.
Do not speak to me like a child, Manfred.
I hate when you do that.
I think you like it.
Ja.
Because I think you have some serious and unresolved issues with your father.
Yeah? And maybe that is why I date a wrinkled old man like you.
- Wow.
- I didn't mean that.
- No, no, it's okay.
I think we both knew it.
- Oh, Mani.
Just strange to hear it out loud.
- Oh, for shit's sake.
- And they didn't do one dish.
- This is funny to you? - I ate a bunch of that LSD you had labeled as baby Aspirin.
- That was baby Aspirin.
- Oh.
Hey, guys? - Wait, what? - What, uh? - What's the plan here? - I shall fetch a rug.
No you will not.
That rug was a gift from the Azeri Khan himself.
And besides, we're not going far.
Is that hard to do? With those big old ballpark frankenfingers? Shut up.
Hurry, the Beekmans will be back any time.
And nobody touch anything.
God, Cyril, would you go? - Unh.
I should be carrying her.
- Cyril, I paid her, I get to carry her corpse.
See? Just look at this bathroom.
I kinda like it.
Exactly.
All right, drop them there next to that awful Louis Quinze repro.
Now then.
We want this to look like a classic hooker-murder-suicide so, Cyril.
Take Sterling's gun and pump a round into his prostitute.
Wait, what? Everyone shoots the chippy.
That way, we're all in it together.
Think of it as a team-building exercise.
ODIN gets to go on Outward Bound.
ODIN can suck it.
Now shoot.
Oh, Jesus.
You're next.
Cyril, that was pathetic.
Come on.
Everybody shoots.
Hey, I wanna go.
Bam! Now, Sterling, drop your gun between the bodies, and No.
Have you never seen CSI? This is already, like, Clue Town.
Not for long.
Dr.
Krieger, dear? What? Oh.
Cyril, call 911 from their phone and leave it off the hook and Sterling.
But this gun, it was a gift.
Oh, please.
Nobody gives you gifts.
You don't know.
Whatever you say, dear.
Dr.
Krieger? Now, then Still didn't get the contract.
Oh, but I will.
And I'll get to see Trudy Beekman try to explain this little barbecue to the co-op board.
That smell takes me back.
- Just like a Zambezi feast.
Yeah, I'm kinda hungry.
- Is that weird? It would be weirder if you weren't.
Well this torte's a winner, Malory.
- What was the name again? - Kladdkaka.
Stop it.
I'm sorry.
That That's a funny word.
Oh, I thought we were laughing at the dead people we set on fire.
Um, sorry.
Oh! Oh, I cannot believe you.
Are you out of your big fat Russian skull? Of all the dumb stunts you've Nikolai, how could you do this? - With KGB surveillance team.
They - Not "how" how, you ass.
"Why" how.
For record of activities in Krakow.
Oh, some blurry eight-millimeter of No, we have the digital hi-def now.
Wonderful.
So they can blow it up for the jury at my treason trial.
Is amazing, no loss of resolution Damn your bloodshot eyes, I'm serious.
I will not let that happen to you.
You let this happen.
And by doing so, jeopardized our entire operation.
Darling, please.
Don't say that.
I have no idea how this Ramón Limón got the disk.
He must have gone rogue.
Oh, all Hispanics look roguish.
The KGB had no idea about my plan.
So please, do not blame Major Jakov.
Oh, right, how could I? The important thing is that the disk does not fall into the wrong hands.
- You mean "wronger" hands.
- Like your government's.
Or mine.
I find it very surprising that Castro okayed an operation with such potential to embarrass the Soviets.
Well, he is unpredictable.
Which is why I am planning ahead for my retirement.
In beautiful Miami.
And so, here are the keys and the deed to my condo in South Beach.
A nice start to a new start.
But what of the financial arrangements? You'll get the money when I get the disk.
And if you've made copies I tried, but the Russian was smart enough to copy-protect the disk.
Yeah, he's a real genius.
But if you try to double-cross me Well, you should know what kind of a man you are dealing with.
- Oh, Ramón.
I think I know exactly what kind of man you are.
Uh, que? I said I could eat the absolute pants off some shrimp.
I don't suppose he's up.
No, mum.
And from the looks of it, not to mention the lemur I would hazard he's taking a personal day.
The hell he is.
Woodhouse, we got any lube? Like at this point even olive oil would help me get that drawer unstuck.
Jesus God, Sterling.
Schoolgirls? - Those are costumes.
- I suppose that makes it better? Doesn't it? Oh, uh, Woodhouse, I told my guests you'd pack their lunch.
I'll do my best, sir.
I'm afraid the lemur got into the pudding cups.
- Yeah, like I told you he would.
You idiot.
- Will you please focus? Now, I know you're familiar with the honey pot.
Seducing and blackmailing a hot female enemy agent.
I love the honey pot.
I'm sure you do.
But this time you may not find the target appealing.
- What, is it Pam? Seriously, whoever.
It's all the same in the dar No.
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes! - No.
No.
Come on.
- Have Gillette do this.
- Sterling, you're the only one I can trust.
And don't even get me started on Miss Gillette.
She has never liked me.
But someday I'm gonna write a book about this place.
Mm-hm.
A real smackarooni.
Sterling, please, I need your help.
This Ramón Limón is blackmailing me.
- With what? What's he got on you? - It's none of your nosy beeswax.
- Well, then it sucks to be you.
You'll be who it sucks to be if I have to call my bridge partner.
Oh, who's your bridge partner? - The district attorney.
- So? Sir, that stolen lemur bit one of your prostitutes right in the face and she says she can't go to hospital because she's, quote, "tripping balls.
" You know, when I was little, I used to pretend you weren't my mother.
- Me too.
Bang.
Bang.
Ew, kill.
Bang.
- Shock.
- Shut up.
Oh, my God, bang.
- I hesitate to even ask.
- We're doing "Kill, Bang, Marry.
" - Again, hesitation.
- It's on the ISIS Intranet.
You click through pictures of everybody who works here, and say if you'd rather - Kill them or bang or marry them.
- Wow, that is entirely inappropriate.
That's what I said.
If you go through the whole list you can see what everybody said.
- Everybody? Like? - Like Lana.
And if, I don't know maybe she said "bang" about Mr.
Archer? - I got ups.
Move it, chubs.
- Hey.
Dr.
Krieger's covert team installed these surveillance cameras while Limón was out shopping yesterday.
Yup, we've got video and audio with a satellite feed back to these hard drives.
- Same set-up I've got in my van.
- Jesus, Krieger.
- You're still taping bum fights? - No, now I'm into something darker.
- Ahem! Since that obnoxious little Castro is such a raging homophobe - Fidel hates the gays.
it's a safe bet he'd have Ramón killed if he ever found out he was gay.
- So once you seduce him - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I thought nobody else was supposed to know about this.
- He won't remember.
- Yeah, no, I'm - I am shitfaced.
Miss Archer, phone call.
- I'm busy.
- Um, we all are? - Bang.
Uh, kill, I guess.
- Thanks a lot.
- It's a bad picture, Pam.
He says it's urgent.
Something about developments in Krakow? Krakow? Oh, for Sterling, get to Miami, and don't come back until you've completed your assignment.
- Taking one for the team, huh? - Hopefully not.
Well if you do, I've developed a proprietary chemical compound which may come in handy.
I call it Formula K.
And it makes you temporarily gay? I don't know.
Just started human testing.
By dosing Danny the intern's coffee.
- Danny is definitely feeling something.
- I think I'm going to pass.
Suit yourself.
Just means more for me and Danny.
Who is loving it.
I have ascertained the target, sir.
And he's actually quite handsome.
And I suppose that makes it better.
- Doesn't it? - No, it Woodhouse, this is Miami.
Don't you have any cooler clothes? - No sir, not anymore.
- And your shoes.
Because how hard is it to poach a goddamn egg properly? Seriously, that's like Eggs 101, Woodhouse.
Now I know you've lost your mind.
You want me to defect to Russia? Just, uh, you know, if the worst happens.
That is the worst.
Standing in the snow for beet rations in my Blahniks? - Come on.
I'm head of KGB.
I have my beets delivered.
- Nikolai.
- Free Stolichnaya, Beluga caviar.
My own private limousine.
The Soviet system is actually incredibly unfair.
- And it just sounds wonderful, but - Hey, I'm just putting it out there.
Well, just put it back in.
You're the whole reason I'm in this mess.
I'm trying to help.
I mean, if that Cuban does not fall for the honey pot.
Oh, I think he will.
I've got my top man on it.
Or possibly bottom.
- Ahem.
Can I help you? - I don't know.
Can you? - Is this some sort of viral marketing? - What? No, I meant Or are you asking me, specifically, if I have a penis? Uh, it's more of a conversation starter.
And here's a conversation ender.
Adios.
- Oh, bilingual snap.
- Thank you.
Do you not see me rocking this chiseled slab of hard man-body? - I mean, come on.
Are you gay or not? - I am.
- But you.
You are so not my type.
- What? Hey, I am everybody's type.
- Oh, please.
- What? - You are entirely too gay.
- No, I'm not.
- Are you kidding? - Oh my God, you, like, sneeze glitter.
Thank you.
So, yeah.
I'm an ISIS agent and that Ramón guy's a Cuban agent and, uh, I'm supposed to run what we call a honey pot on him.
I can't believe you have all this stuff and it's, like, portable.
I can't believe you blab that you're a secret agent.
I can't believe you're a hairdresser and Rudi's an interior decorator.
- God, he's the best in Miami.
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome, sir.
- Lf I had a spoon No, no, no.
I would eat you up.
- Don't be nice.
So this spy agency, is it, like, the real CIA "James Bondy" deal, or what? Charles, ISIS employs some of the world's foremost intelligence analysts, covert operatives, and scientists.
- Wait, did Cyril play this stupid game? - You'll have to play to find out.
Danny.
Danny, stop running.
We gotta keep that heart rate down, buddy.
Okay, kill.
Bang.
Bang.
- Ew, kill.
- Well, thanks a lot.
- Pam, it's a bad picture.
- I think that's hot.
Like, somebody murdering me? It's so intimate.
- So, yeah, basically, we're the front line in the fight against tyranny.
Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- I wanna dress you up like a little gnome and just have you live in my garden.
- I would like some new clothes.
Shut up.
But also and speaking of clothes these seem way too normal.
- What, normal as opposed to gay? Implying that gay is abnormal? Not abnormal, just gay.
In spite of your personality, you get plenty of women, right? Uh, duh and or hello.
So, "duh and or hello," just act like you normally do around women.
- Really? Because how hard is it to poach a goddamn egg properly? I believe he means before you lure them into the apartment, sir.
Oh.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
So I just like, what? Approach him in a bar? - Yeah, If I were you, I'd try The Cock Fight.
- What? A cockfight? - It's the name of a gay bar.
- They also have actual cockfights.
Yeah, Latino men.
You take the bad with the good.
Jesus, what's your problem? - You are.
Blonde, brunette.
I thought I made it clear you are not my type.
Is that where we landed on that, because l Dios mío.
Is your ego so large you cannot handle a single rejection? - Yes.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I already have a drink.
Why don't you buy him one? He could use it.
Why Why don't we all have one and talk about it.
Seriously Woodhouse, how can you be so totally awesome and not be gay? Well, I was very fond of a boy at school once.
Reggie Thistleton.
- But he died in the war, at Flanders.
- Flanders? - What war was that? - Oh, the Great War.
- They're all great.
- Oh, my God, yes, those Nazi uniforms? - Hugo Boss.
- Shut up.
Swear to God.
And look at slut, just getting home.
- Well, I guess our advice worked.
- No, it didn't.
- Ramón blew me off.
- Then where were you all night? Way the Christ out in the Everglades burying some Dominican guy's rooster.
- Fun.
- Oh, you mean literally.
- Yes.
Sorry.
- I mean, look at my clothes.
And what the hell are you wearing, Woodhouse? - L - We bought those for him.
If you throw them off the roof I'll fly to New York and fling acid in your face.
- Thank you.
Oh, great.
Mother, I have nothing to report yet.
This is a lot harder than I thought.
How hard could it be to talk a gay man into having anonymous sex? - See the stereotypes we put up with? - You don't know what I'm dealing with.
You don't know what I'm dealing with! See? Here is my nice building, my limousine, my mother.
Oh, and my apartment is two bedrooms, so she won't even have to move out.
So you just listen to me, Mr.
Man.
Get me some video of hot man-on-man action by tonight or don't bother coming home.
- She sounds fabulous.
- Yeah, she's actually not.
But the stereotype thing got me thinking because, let's see, Ramón is Latino - And Latinos are all about machismo.
So you may have to out-macho him.
Out-macho a gay guy? Oh, my stars.
Or, wait, you could just be a sarcastic bitch your whole life.
- Thank you.
Wait a Did you set this whole thing up just so I'd have to come live with you and your mother? - No! It was merely incompetence.
- And I suppose that makes it better? Doesn't it? Wait a minute, how do you know Ramón's playing jai alai right now? - Um, he's Latino.
- So it's either that or dominoes.
Stereotypes exist for a reason.
Okay, we're off to get our scrotums waxed.
Ramón, hey.
I have a proposition for you.
Mama, have to call you back.
- Don't you ever give up? - Not when it comes to somebody refusing to have sex with me.
- You know, consensually or whatever.
- Hmm.
So me and you, one on one, loser has to do whatever the winner says.
- Lf I win I want you to leave me alone.
- Fine.
But if I win we go to your place and have, you know gay sex.
- Have you ever played jai alai? Uh, actually, lacrosse.
But it's jai alai for white people.
- Lacrosse is gay.
- You're gay.
I mean, I am too.
- We're both gay.
- Seriously, I can serve this pelota almost two hundred miles an hour.
- Big whoop, that little squishy - Jesus, is this made of limestone? - It's a dangerous game.
Yeah? Well, I'm dangerous.
And I'm gonna win.
- And gay sex.
- Okay.
- Go stand over there.
- Where, over here? - Mm, little more far.
- What, here? - Is this? - Sí, sí.
That's good, right there.
That's what you're gonna be saying when I'm, uh, all inside you with gay sex.
- Are you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready.
- Wait, do I need a helmet? - Probably.
Wait, what? I mean, after all you are playing a very dangerous game Sterling Archer of ISIS.
There he is.
Welcome back, amigo.
Jesus Christ, who apparently uses the same awful decorator as my mother.
Trust me, whoever decorated this condo is not in heaven.
And neither are you Agent Sterling Archer of ISIS.
- Wait, you know who I am? Duh and or hola.
- So you know why I'm here.
- I assume because your mother forced you to pose as a gay man, in hopes of catching me in a, how you say pot of honey.
- Yeah, which is just so classic her.
- Oh, you should meet my mother.
She - No, no, no, shut up, listen.
My mother - Oh, my God, that's her.
- Dios mío.
It's her.
L I can't believe we hung up on them.
- That was so thoroughly awesome, Ramón.
- This is awesome.
- Here, try it.
- No.
Whoa, whoa.
- It's raw, man.
- No, the citric acid from the limes actually cooks the fish.
Try it.
Mm.
Mm! - Oh, my, Ramón, that is amazing.
- Right? Mama always said: Mine always said: "Sterling, come in here and check me for lumps.
" - Holy shit, was that out loud? - It's okay.
This is a safe place.
- Yeah, but it's not, though.
- Are you referring to these? - Ha.
You found Krieger's cameras? - I think he is not so good at his job.
Danny! Dude, that whole agency's not so good at their jobs.
Kill.
Kill.
God, when do I get to the end so I can see what Cyril said? - You don't think that's hot? - I seriously think you're scary.
No, no, no, like, a big sweaty fireman carries you out of a burning building, lays you on the sidewalk.
You think, he's gonna give me mouth-to-mouth.
But instead he just starts choking the shit out of you and the last sensation that you feel before you die is he is squeezing your throat so hard that a big wet blob of drool drips off his teeth and just: "Blurp!" Falls right onto your popped-out eyeball.
- Jesus Christ.
- I know, right? - What the hell? - I'm wet just thinking about it.
Cyril? Cyril, you get your ass out here right now.
Is she freaking cause Cyril said he wanted to bang Danny? No, it's cause he said he wanted to marry her.
She's so weird.
Hey, will you choke me a little bit? Pfft.
That's nothing compared to the pendejos I have to work with.
- You haven't banged half of them like yours truly.
- I can't.
If Fidel found out I'm gay, he'd - Well, that's why you're here.
- And maybe it's the concussion but I seriously feel crappy about that.
- No.
I feel crappy.
I should not have tried to blackmail your mother.
Yeah, what's on this thing anyway? Get on the floor, you tacky-ass, white-after-Labor-Day-wearing bitches.
Thank you.
- Charles and Rudi? What the? - What is the meaning of this? - Sorry.
We're a hit squad.
Turns out Fidel is unhappy that one of his top agents is gay.
Ay, dios mío! Hey.
Save your breath for cooling your ceviche.
- Ceviche is already cold.
- I know.
You dicks were working for Castro this whole time? Positutely, yes.
But we were having such a blast hanging with Woodhouse - Who's fine by the way.
- I'm genuinely sorry about this.
- But may I can keep the clothes? Forever and always.
- Not that you care.
- Yeah, I actually don't.
- So are you two even really gay? - As big old tangerines, yes.
Then how can you work for Castro? You know his stance on homosexuality.
Because, commie, I have something called a mortgage.
Hey, whoa, if this is about money, I know somebody who'd pay a whole lot of money to get this back.
- Sterling, no.
- Hey, Ramón, shut up.
- Let the mummy talk.
- I can't let you do this.
What the? - You'll never take me alive, bastardos.
Let's outsource it to some cracked-up Haitians that's what I said.
You know why? So you could be all Little Miss "Hindsight's 20-20.
" - Here, take this.
- Why did you have a salad gun? - Ah, I was going to kill you.
- Oh, you are just the worst kind of Me? Your mother started all of this.
So give them the freaking disk If I do that it will become public.
And if you see what's on this disk - Well if you weren't gay, you will be.
- Ha, ha! Well, what is it? A sex tape of Mother? - Ahem.
- Oh, my But there, you see.
It's gone.
So it's okay, just let it all Jesus, God, do you ladies want to put on your nightgowns crack open a tube of cookie dough and talk? Goddamn it, we're dealing with some profound issues here you queer.
- What the hell, man? Sorry, I meant homosexual person.
No, you idiota.
We have a finite number of bullets.
- Oh, my bad.
- Oh, my bad.
- Ha, ha.
Now who feels stupid? - My guess is both of you.
Since the last thing you see is gonna be that horrific sofa.
Shut up, I bet you're not even a real interior decorator.
Well, he's not licensed or anything, but he's got a real flair for it.
- Thank you.
- So how about stand up and let us paint the walls with your brains.
- Here, take this.
Jesus, Ramón, a Claymore? - I can explain.
- You were gonna frag me? No.
This was for decorating.
What, look at this place.
- I was going to have to start from scratch.
- The kitchen's not bad.
Oh, God, are you kidding? That kitchen is awful Oh, crap.
No, thank you.
Ramón, was that not totally epic? Sí, Sterling.
Because you lived to tell the tale.
No, no, no, because my mother's condo got trashed.
God, she is gonna freak when Wait, where's Charles and Rudi? Hmm.
I think they must have escaped, however implausible that may seem.
That does seem implausible.
And so, I must now go into hiding.
Fidel will keep sending hit squads and he will not stop until I am dead.
- So, what, just a life on the run? Sí, just like el Doctor David Banner.
- How do you say "The Hulk" in Spanish? - El Hulk.
- Gay.
- What? - We don't have a word for "Hulk.
" - Do you have a word for "gay?" - Gay.
- Gayer! Jesus, Spanish, our jobs aren't enough.
- Now you got to take our words? - Sterling.
I didn't mean that, it was racist.
And even though you were gonna shoot and or frag me I feel like we had kind of a connection.
I'm sad because we had a connection, and now And now I feel like a dick so come on.
- Let me turn that frown upside down.
- How? Well, the bedroom was untouched by the explosion.
- I'm listening.
- So let's blow the shit out of it.
Oh.
I thought you meant you wanted to - Ramón.
- And just why is that so funny? Not that.
Woodhouse.
He's all tied up somewhere.
Scared Scared and alone.
Probably dehydrated.
I get to go to the French Riviera on the ISIS dime to do what? Locate a stolen shipment of Redeye missiles and kill the arms dealer trying to sell them, Spirodon Skorpio.
Whoa, what, is diabetes busy? Don't underestimate Skorpio.
There's a reason the bounty on him is so high.
- Like, high enough to redo my kitchen? - Ugh.
What did I tell you? That Saltillo tile is terrible for a kitchen because it's so porous.
And Mexican whore-house-y.
So I'm sure your cook feels at home.
- Hey, Pita isn't a whore.
- Not until you got a hold of her.
- First of all - Oh, shut up.
The bounty on Skorpio is more than enough for a new kitchen - I also have the nook And the rest you can set aside for Pita's inevitable medical expenses.
Ugh.
Like, one time that happened.
It's pretty late.
Why don't you take a cab? Mr.
Sterling? I have problem.
I'll pay for it.
Again? Seriously, Pita You're killing me here.
Again? This was supposed to be coconut shrimp.
One, three times.
But it's the Pope's fault she won't let me wear a condom.
- Why don't you wear a vasectomy? - This again? Don't you want a grandkid? Well, if I did, I'd just scrape all your previous mishaps into a big pile and knit a onesie for it.
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry, I've been fasting and I'm edgy.
- Still though - Sterling.
- Okay.
If there's money left after the kitchen, then vasectomy maybe.
You do want the assignment? - Yeah, I want it.
- You really, really, really want it? Yes.
I really want it.
Well, too bad.
Because guess what.
Womp-womp.
- Why does she get the mission? - Because I said so.
Either way, we have a plane to catch.
We? Why are you going? I'm going to, um, a conference? Oh, well, isn't that convenient? If you think that's convenient, wait till you see my new kitchen.
Ha! Seriously though, you should look through some of her design catalogs.
So, zoom, you're just jetting off to France? - Isn't that kind of sudden? - No, baby.
Sudden is wanting to move in with somebody after four months.
Talking.
Just talking about it.
You know, I mean, jeez, I moved in with my last girlfriend after four weeks.
- What are you, a lesbian? Why, would you be into that? Just curious.
Which was an odd word choice right there, and am I talking out loud? Now remember, I want the entire data system on those new servers or I will just make it rain pink slips.
- I'm not doing that.
- That's a poor motivator.
Lana, I want you to call or text me at the top of every hour.
- I'll call or text at the - I'm gonna be kind of busy, hon.
Well, it's all on this schedule.
Oh, no, honey.
The doors are closing and I didn't get the Oh, so close.
So your conference wouldn't be for control freaks who micro-manage everything, would it? - What? No, that's not why I'm But look, you be careful with Skorpio.
He won't hesitate to kill you.
- Unless I get smothered to death.
- Oh.
That's just pathetic.
- But even though Cyril may be clingy - Oh.
Saran Wrap could take a lesson.
- You used to complain constantly that Sterling was emotionally distant.
Yeah, I was just being nice, though.
I wonder if he's like that because I used to spank him with a wooden spoon.
Uh Yeah, I don't know about that, but it might explain the ping-pong paddle.
My point is, dear, you can trust Cyril.
Now you go have a fun assassination.
Okay, and you go have fun at your thing.
Oh, I will.
Bye, dear.
Did you rent a boat? Da, is very Ahem.
Pretty nice boat.
It better be, Mr.
Sex-Tape.
And you, scuff that luggage, and I'll cut your hamstrings for you.
- I think we're making some progress.
- Where, in opposite-world? - We're never gonna finish all this.
- We can, if certain people would help.
I'm sorry, are you addressing me? Because your authority is not recognized in Fort Kickass.
- Ugh! Mr.
Archer, you could help.
Hey, I'm helping Cyril.
Text her again.
- I am, if you'd shut up.
- And really pour out your feelings.
- Don't listen to him, he's just trying to Shut up! Cyril, bare your soul.
So, heh-heh, did I say is nice boat, or what? Yes, Nikolai, you certainly did which hopefully explains my shock at finding myself aboard the Chum Guzzler.
I am just getting that.
Well, I know what you're not getting.
- Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me my phone.
- No, get off.
Cut it out.
Cyril, goddamn it, you're smothering Lana.
- Pam, I will hit you in the face.
- Aha-ha-ow! Don't listen to her, Cyril.
If there's one thing women totally love it's to be smothered by men.
- Heh.
Like you'd know.
- Or choked, in your case.
Cyril, trust me.
Give her some space.
But why hasn't she called? I mean, what if she's in danger? - Or Or Cyril, come on.
Worst-case scenario, her cover got blown and Skorpio's raping her senseless - Oh! before he chops her battered corpse into fish food.
- What is wrong with you? - How can you say that? What? I said "worst-case.
" Leave that to your field agent.
Why must you always micro-manage? I don't.
And if you will recall I used to be an excellent field agent.
Da, is why I fall in love with you.
My God, Kolya, we were so young.
Young and in love, and in Berlin.
On that magical moonlit night, beneath the Bridge of Spies.
The night before you break my heart, and disappear for nine months.
Kolya, there's something I've been meaning to tell you.
What is in this drink? Sorry, is ice from cooler.
- Somehow it got butter all over it.
Aah! Hey, don't be queen of drama.
That wasn't me, you idiot.
Oh, dear God.
- Cyril, give it to me.
- I bet that's Lana.
- It's my phone.
Pam put yours in the blender.
- Come on.
It's called tough love, Cyril.
- The secret ingredient is phone.
Hello.
Mother.
What? Really? - And you're sure it was Lana? - What was Lana? - Okay, I'm on it.
What? Yes.
God.
- Come on.
- What did she say? - Well, she's still really pro-vasectomy.
- About Lana.
- Oh, right.
Yeah, so remember that worst-case scenario we talked about? - Oh, my God.
- Yes, yes, I remember.
- Archer, if anything - Cyril, relax.
I will rescue her.
So, Krieger? How's about a roadie? It would be nice to know what kind of danger I'm facing.
What danger? They do it outpatient.
What? Not the vasectomy, the rescue.
How would I know? I'm at a conference.
- Wait a minute.
- You don't have a minute.
Now, will you just put a lid on it? All right, I'm going.
- Shitty flying rats.
Just put the damn lid on it.
Commence Operation: "Something about I rescue Lana and she begs me to take her back, so then Cyril commits suicide.
" I swear to God I had something for this.
Seriously, are you just bailing on this whole assignment, or what? Who gives a gosh-damn about that? Lana's captured, maybe even Rescued, Kenny Crybaby.
Come on.
I bet Mr.
Archer already went all double-oh-ninja on Skorpio's ass.
Waa-paah! - Karate sound.
- You really think so? Cyril, right this second I bet he's untying Lana taking off her ball gag - Her what? - And she's looking up into his steely-blue eyes and parting her moist lips - Wait a minute.
- Yeah, hang on, crazy pants.
- Let her talk, woman.
- As he takes her in his rippling Rambo-y arms, throws her down - Oh, my God and then yeah! Oh, yeah! That's right! Give it to me! Uhn! Damn it, look what you Shouldn't you be off cooking a rabbit somewhere? - I've got some in the lab.
- I mean, maybe it's not that but there's only one way to find out.
- Give me that.
Oh, Jesus, God.
- I thought I gave you a fake number.
What? - Archer, it's me.
- Cyril? Hey, I can't really talk right now.
Well, that's too bad, Mr.
Man.
Now, you just put Lana on the phone.
- Well, Cyril I can't really do that either.
- He says he can't put her on.
- Archer, put her on the phone.
- Cyril, buddy, look when I see her, I will tell her to call you but I can't freaking talk right now! Archer? Hello? He hung up.
Probably cause he's all: Oh, my God, I can't breathe.
And that's the reason I don't have sex with my co-workers.
- That and no one ever lets me.
- I've had good results with ether.
Oh, no! Oh, my God, Nikolai, something's wrong.
Is just fat dripping from kebabs.
Not that.
Kolya, my people need help.
- Do you have any KGB agents nearby? - Meh - "Meh" what? - I just don't feel so comfortable discussing KGB operations with you.
- What? I tell you everything.
Da, but is a little unprofessional.
Swear to God, Lana better be dead on a slab or begging for mercy over a vat of acid or a shark tank or - Drinking champagne in a bikini? - Oh, screw me.
Two minutes, my love.
I am just now again re-shaving my balls again.
First of all, you have no right to interfere with my operation.
And not that it's any of your beeswax, but I did not have sex with Skorpio.
- Oh, really? - No.
God.
I just kept putting him off, making him re-shave his balls.
Oh.
So you can hang out on a boat? It's a mega-yacht.
And I just I needed a break from Cyril.
Who thinks you got captured, or killed.
- What was that all about? - Um Uh I actually forget what that was.
I've been hitting the sauce pretty hard.
- Jesus.
You are so irresponsible.
- Oh, really? Go ask Pita who's irresponsible.
Hey, she knew the job was risky going in.
- And since you didn't do your job - I will, all right? Just give me like a week.
Too late! You had your chance and you blew it.
- Now, how's my disguise? - Depends.
Who are you supposed to be? Topper Bottoms, stern yet sensual skipper of the USS Rough Service? - What, they're your clothes, idiot.
- Uhn! Oh, damn it, that was the guy in charge of the chocolate fountain.
- There's a chocolate fountain? - Oh.
There's everything.
Great champagne, ridiculous food a whole, like, squad of hot little Filipina masseuses.
- Skeet? - Probably.
I just really need some me time before I have to go back to Cyril and his whole Curiously oppressive brand of love? - I mean, come on, haven't I earned that? - Yes, we have.
I'm staying.
- What? No.
No, you're not.
- Yes.
Yes, I am.
Or would you prefer I tell Cyril you slept with Skorpio? - Even you wouldn't stoop that low.
- Lana, come on this is me, remember? Unprofessional? From the man who used an entire KGB surveillance team just to make a sex tape of me? Ha.
And entire KGB art department to airbrush wrinkles off your old ass.
I want to leave, please.
Right now.
So who's stopping you? Hmm.
Hmm.
Smiles everyone, smiles.
For this party, everything must be as perfect as my beautiful companion.
- Ha-ha.
Because in one hour, the world's most dangerous terrorists will gather here, on the Argo, to bid on my humble wares.
Wait, wait, you.
Chocolate-fountain guy.
You look, uh different.
- Oh! - Um, I guess I've been working out? - Yes, I can see that.
- Quick.
Bring me some duct tape.
- I, uh Because this malaka is ripped.
Come, my dear.
Before the party, I must relax on top of you.
- Ugh.
No excuses, huh? My balls are smooth.
- And you know I love that.
- Not as much as I love chocolate.
- Oh-hoh-hoh.
- So, you, malaka, bring plenty of it, yes.
I would prefer not to.
Bartleby, the Scrivener? Anybody? Not a big Melville crowd, here, huh? Yeah, he's not an easy read.
And I drove her right into his arms.
His big, tan, muscle-bulgy arms.
Cyril, come on.
Don't listen to What the hell is your name now, anyway? - I don't even remember.
Exactly.
So - What are you snorting off me? - It's mostly MSG.
- The flavor enhancer.
- Which you so need.
Pipe down, pipe cleaner.
And, Cyril, it's a rescue mission, okay? - Probably fraught with danger.
- You really think so? I bet they're fighting for their lives.
Wow.
Yeah, that That got a little dark.
So now we have champagne, huh? - Um, got anything a little stronger? - Or way stronger.
Like poison? Mm.
I think I have just the thing.
- Oh, my God.
- Ready the shark tank for my guests Agents Archer and Kane, of ISIS.
- What? You knew the whole time? How you say? Womp-womp.
- All right, you heard Mr.
Skorpio.
- No, just Skorpio.
Remember? How we're doing that from now on? - Sorry, sir.
- Hang on just one second.
Where was this enthusiasm before? I know, right? Now he wants to contribute.
M Ha-ha.
Oh, funny.
Actually, I'm getting this.
Damn, I had something for this too.
Damn it.
Eat grenade, stupids.
- Oh, well, now what? - Ugh.
Are you still here? - Where'd you get a grenade? - Hanging from the lampshade.
Wait, what? - What? Did he just call me a whore? - Now, why on earth would he do that? Because he turns women into whores.
Just ask his slutty Mexican cook.
Oh, my God, yes.
We should call her, because I would literally murder somebody for some migas right now.
Every single noun and verb in that sentence totally arouses me.
And I'm so open to that.
And, Cyril, ignore her.
Nothing's going on between Archer and Lana.
- Although - Although what? Well, every ISIS agent has a company-issued life-insurance policy, and And what? - You're my beneficiary! - Your what? On my company life insurance.
Oh, my God.
I mean, if this goes tits-up.
Now? Really? Oh, right.
Because you walked into Strippers' Discount Warehouse and said, "Help me showcase my intellect.
" Discount? Hello, this is Fiacci.
Uh I think it's pronounced, "Knock-off.
" Right after I get back, I'm changing that stupid policy.
Ugh! Yes, you're my beneficiary.
How'd you get life insurance, Lana? Don't they know you're in the danger zone? But that doesn't mean anything.
I mean they could've forgotten to fill out new beneficiary forms Cyril, they have to update those bennie forms every quarter.
- Ouch.
- But that means Oh, my God.
Damn ass-hammered shit! - What? - Benefits! I forgot to spend the balance in my goddamn flex-account! - Are you date-of-employment, or? - Calendar-year! - Ouch.
- That's just leaving money on the table.
How did you forget that? I guess I was busy fantasizing about Archer and Lana having intercourse! - Ouch.
- Cyril, come on, hon, we all were.
And you expect me to believe that? I don't care.
Just like I don't ever think about you.
- Reloading.
- Firing.
So when you filled out your insurance, you weren't thinking about my muscular arms or my ass, in the combat-firing stance? - No, I wasn't.
I don't.
I mean, I'm So full of shit, your eyes are brown.
No, they're Oh, my God, they're green.
Like emeralds.
How did I never see that? - Lana, your eyes are amazing.
- Archer.
I mean, not compared to your tits, but Ow! Ow! What is your problem? You.
And plus, I have a boyfriend.
Oh, right, how could I forget Mr.
Cling? Cyril? Cyril, come on.
Let go.
Oh, God, he's stronger than he looks.
Get him out of here! Because these corporate bag-munchers owe me 630 dollars for my goddamn flex-account! I cannot believe you shot me.
God, you know how much I hate that.
- You better get used to it.
- Kill them, you fools.
Kill them.
Oh, my God.
I am gonna die and you're the last man I was in bed with.
Well, one of them.
Don't worry, I won't tell Cyril.
Probably.
- Shit.
I'm out of ammo.
Archer! - Lana.
Lana.
- Do you trust me? - What? No, I don't trust you.
Well, that's too bad.
Because guess what.
Oh, my God.
Nikolai.
Our son.
- Our what? - Oh, so remember that little something I wanted to tell you? A little something? Oh, that is just classic you.
- So I'm a little late.
- A lot late.
No one could have survived that.
Oh, man! Whoo! I am awesome! Ugh.
And it just keeps on getting better.
- Lana? - Asshole? Oh, my God.
Was that not epic? - First of all - Nikolai, look, they're alive.
- Oh, thank God.
- Thank God? For what? The lying woman I risk my career for? The son she don't told me of? Or maybe my damn security deposit? Security deposit.
What was it, a pair of flip-flops? - Half the bounty.
Come on, I deserve it.
- Ha! Too bad.
So you can just paddle that hole in your foot right on back to your cheesy, Mexican kitchen Oh, I'll get a new kitchen.
Let's see you get a new boyfriend after I have a talk with Cyril.
Ha! About what, exactly? How you cried during a two-man threesome? Wooden spoons are a huge emotional trigger for me, Lana.
Yeah, and now I know.
And when I tell Pam so will everybody in the office.
- Oh, is that how you wanna play it? - Yeah.
Fine! Keep your stupid bounty, then! And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.
I will.
Oh, and Cyril may be clingy, but at least I know I can trust him.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Cyril, come on.
Snap out of it, seriously.
It's not like we burned down the mainframe.
You really need to relax.
How? My life is ruined.
Again.
Look, what happens on this scratchy green office rug stays on this scratchy green office rug, okay? You mean this, what we just did, you'll keep this our secret? Yeah.
God, Cyril.
You can trust me.
You know, probably.
Probably? Womp-womp.
All aboard, for safety and adventure! On the rigid airship Excelsior where the pampered luxury of a cruise ship meets the smoothness of modern air travel.
Yes, when you fly Excelsior, you're flying in style! - And safety! Safety? - But isn't hydrogen flammable? - And how, Timmy! That's why Excelsior is filled with safe natural helium.
Why, it's actually flame-retardant! - Neat! - And safe! So, whether you're enjoying Excelsior's majestic vistas duty-free shopping, high-stakes baccarat dancing with your lovely wife or even a cigar after a French gourmet dinner you'll be enjoying them in style.
And safety! - All aboard Excelsior! God.
Who'd wanna put a bomb on that? That's what we're hoping ISIS can find out.
No, why bother? Some broad gets on there with a staticky sweater, and boom, it's: "Oh, the humanity!" - No, no, that - Sterling.
Were you watching some other commercial just now? It's a rigid airship.
- Filled with helium.
- Which is non-flammable! Dumb-ass.
I thought our promotional video covered that fairly well.
Oh, and how.
Sterling, it's totally safe.
Well, except for the bomb threat.
No, not to worry, dear.
ISIS won't let terrorists blow up your lovely blimp.
- Rigid airship.
- My top two agents will be on board.
- Nope! - And I will oversee the operation personally from what I assume will be first-class accommodations.
Oh, actually we are fully booked.
Well, if you think, oh, I don't know this "Trudy Beekman" person can thwart a major terror plot.
I suppose we could bump Mrs.
Beekman.
- Bump me, I'm not going.
- Lf these two share a cabin.
- Nope! - Not going to let the terrorists win! - We'll pose as husband and wife! - Nope! Cyril would totally freak.
Malory, let me stay with you.
We'll do the whole Oprah-Gayle thing.
Nope! I need a stateroom to myself in case I have a gentleman caller.
- Um - Mother, please.
- Please do not make me do this.
- But Lana think of the innocent lives you'll be saving.
And also the fact that this is a direct order.
At least tell me it's separate beds.
- Um Hmm.
Ugh.
Lana.
Lana.
Lana! - Lana! - What? Danger zone! Terrible, awful, just gut-wrenchingly bad feeling about this.
Baby, I really need you to trust me.
Okay, now is the cabin small? Yes.
And yet surprising amount of storage.
- Ugh.
And I'll hardly be in here, okay? I've got a terrorist to find, and I doubt he's hiding under - What's basically a twin bed.
- Archer.
Since it's all drawers under here, because look how tiny this room is! - Oh, my God, it's like a broom closet.
- And yet, a surprising amount of storage.
Oh, shut up, and Cyril? - Very eager to know why you're still here.
- He was just - Just helping Lana get settled.
- Trust me, Cyril.
She already settled.
- Hey! - Hey! Disembark, Cyril.
We're about to launch, or whatever blimps do.
Yeah, what does a blimp do, Pam? Uh Kick your skinny ass? Now come on, we gotta get off this thing before Relax! God, we've got half an hour.
Oh.
Well then, make me a double Campari and, uh I guess vodka? - We don't normally drink on the bridge.
- Well, I don't normally fly on the Hindenburg 2.
0.
- It's not Cyril doesn't normally storm off without even kissing me goodbye! We're all out of our comfort zone.
- Not me, my stateroom is gorgeous.
- Oh.
That, what's her name, Beekman? I bet she's just sick she got bumped.
Yes, she literally vomited from anger.
So if we could just focus on the bomb threat? How about crew members? - Anyone who might be disgruntled? - Um That's Lieutenant Krauss.
He and I were both up for command of the Excelsior, but You got it.
Leaving him with motive.
Release the mooring cable! Come on! It's not Larry Luftwaffe, that's Oopsie.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ugh, way too obvious.
God damn it! We're moving! - I know! - What happened to half an hour? - I lied! - What? Why the hell are you two still here? Because I knew you'd be here, because you don't trust Lana with Mr.
Archer.
No! No, now that is - So ironic, Cyril! Ugh.
- Especially in light of recent No.
rug-burny events.
- Oh, my God! You two banged? L Uh See, here's the thing - Fruit basket! - Wow.
You are just a dog in a manger.
I don't know what that means, Pam.
- I didn't grow up on a cheese farm.
- Oh, for the It's called a dairy.
Even a hint of a problem on our maiden voyage would kill Excelsior's stock price.
So, Lana, canvas the passengers and crew learn what you can about Krauss - But please, be discreet! Hey, good advice! Which maybe I'll just sort of fold in with my 12 years of experience as a covert operative.
Don't be snotty.
And Sterling, if there is a bomb Captain, dear, where would it do the most damage? - Probably in - This new place called anywhere? - This whole thing's a bomb.
Jesus! - It's not - Wanna blow us all to shit, Sherlock? - Ow! - Sterling! - For the last time the Excelsior is filled with non-flammable helium! Although this is a non-smoking area, sir.
Damn it, he's a prospective investor! Not after that, I bet.
And forget about Krauss.
There's your bomber.
- Who? What? That guy.
Beardsley McTurbanhead.
You idiot.
That's Sandu Singh, the billionaire investor! - He's a Sikh! - Oh, so if he's not a Muslim he just gets a pass? That's called profiling, Mother, and I don't do it.
- Singh is Excelsior's majority shareholder.
- So? If anything went wrong on this flight, he'd lose millions.
- It's a perfect cover.
- Sterling.
Just look for the stupid bomb.
Relax.
What do we have, like, four hours before we get to London? - Sterling, are you joking? - The crossing takes 24 hours.
- Are you joking? What? - Rigid airships combine the pampering of a cruise ship with the speed of - Some other, slightly faster ship? Uh Hello, airplanes? Yeah, it's blimps.
You win, bye! Oh, God.
- I hope you didn't invest in this.
- It'll be fine, though.
As long as nothing goes wrong on this flight.
Oh, captain, my captain with ISIS on board, what could possibly go wrong? Pick one! Either A, I tell Lana what happened on that scratchy green office rug or two, you get inside me.
Or C, maybe I just jam this mop into the engine and kill all of us.
- I don't think that's how blimps work.
- Darn, right.
We'd just sort of float around.
Stupid naturally safe helium! But I am liking the jamming imagery.
- And the killing.
- And are you just gonna sit there? Yeah, until she tags me in! - What? - I'm kidding! My back's all messed up.
So you're ruining Cyril's life because in your "dream the impossible dream" world, it'll make Mr.
Archer jealous? Oh, Pamela.
You read me like a poem.
Yeah? What's the poem gonna be about when Cyril snaps and murders you? I don't know.
World's gushiest orgasm? Can you just get out of the way! - What, are you gonna shoot me again? - Yes! Oh.
Well, then hang on.
Cyril's already freaked out enough about us sharing this shoebox without you air-drying your unkempt bush.
Unkempt bush? You're one to talk.
Ah.
My vulva is smoother than a veal cutlet.
- With terrible timing.
- Oh, really.
- Baby - Did I interrupt something? Oh Rehearsal with your Commodores tribute band? Archer! Cyril, what are you doing here? I wanted to tell you something very important but apparently you're too busy showing off your vealy vulva! Cyril! You know, your whole trust thing, and I've tried to, okay? Okay, you know what? We are on a break! - Oh, yeah? Yeah! - Well, that's fine by me.
- Cyril, wait.
No running! Shut up.
- Oh, my God, what have l - What're you doing? Go after him! - Oh.
You think I should? - Yes! We're almost out of fruit.
Which is why I find it strange that you're so incredibly calm.
Well, that seaweed wrap just slurps out the stress.
Can't wait to tell Trudy Beekman all about it.
Lf, um, we ever meet.
- What about you? Anything on Krauss? - No.
Shut up.
- Have you seen Cyril? - What? Why would I have? - And what the hell is he doing? - Hey! - What'd I tell you, huh? Huh? - Ow! Uhn! There! Go buy a nicotine patch! - Gentlemen.
- No, no, no, what happened to discretion? - What happened to that bartender? - Right? Guy sees an empty glass and all of a sudden he's Judge Crater.
- Oh, for God's sake! Nigel, some chips for mister? Archer.
Ha.
Sterling Archer.
The minimum bet is ten thousand, sir.
Dollars.
I stuffed all my money in that guy's mouth, because Well, perhaps we could play for something much more interesting.
Yeah, cause that was seriously, like, all the cash I had on me, so.
So if I win, I spend a night of passion with your exquisite wife.
- My wi? Oh, yes, my wife, of course.
- Oh! Yeah, that's a deal! But if I win you tell me where the bomb What? - Baccarat! Mr.
Singh wins.
- Wait, wait, wait, we were going? - The von Zeppelin suite.
I shall expect her within the hour.
She's not gonna be happy about that.
Um What, are you mostly paid in tips? - Almost entirely, sir.
- Heh.
Ahem.
Mm-hm.
Well, whose fault is that? Prancing around in your Fiacci knockoffs blathering about your vulva.
- Hey, first of all I'm just saying! You're driving Cyril straight toward another woman.
Cyril? With another woman? Malory, seriously.
Look at me.
Look at me! Look at and choke me! - Oh, yes, yes! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God, what am I doing? - Ruining your life, you idiot.
- Ha-ha-ha.
And making it hard to drop a deuce.
- Uh I'm sorry, what? - You.
Now.
Led Zeppelin suite.
You have no proof Singh's the bomber.
- He hinted - That's profiling.
that the proof was in his cabin! - Really? Yes! So go down there and find it while I go find the bomb.
- Ugh.
Bombs, bombers, vulvas.
- You people are just ruining my trip.
Uh Well, don't stand here gaping at me! Go thwart something! - No running! - Zip it, Zipperface! Oh.
Kidding, sorry.
Hey, have you seen that nerdy fruit-basket steward? Check the Kaiser Wilhelm suite.
You really need new names on Hey, what were you doing in there? Things for authorized personnel only! So don't go in there.
It's verboten! Ah.
Okay.
Probably merits a follow-up.
Archer? - Cyril? What're you? Archer, I need your help! I think I'm losing it here, man! What gave it away, my mother's? Why are you wearing my mother's robe? - I can explain.
- I don't think I want you to.
- See, it all started when you and Lana - Cyril! You should tell her this.
I tried! But you were naked and it was all vulva this, and vulva that.
Yeah, and as you're standing here, dick and or balls caressed by my mother's robe, ugh Lana is waiting for you.
- Really? Where? The Led Zeppelin suite.
- There's a von Zeppelin suite.
- Which I'm sure is what I meant.
So, go! - Thanks, Archer! You're the best! - I know.
So yes, the bottom line is that I was unfaithful to you.
Two Well, three times, I guess, if a dry-humpy choker counts.
And if you can't see it in your heart to forgive me I will forgive you.
Because that's what love is, Lana.
It's forgivey.
Which is not a word.
Come on, Figgis! All right, here we go.
- Oh, why? - Hello! - So, that's your idea of a break, huh? - Cyril! It's not what it looks like! Well, then, what is it? Okay, so Cyril got in over his head.
- Jesus, God, did he kill her? No, no, no, he ran from her! To go confess to Lana but so then this one starts freaking out, and long story short I kinda had to drown her in the tub.
- So you killed her? Apparently not, so good news.
Shut up, Pam.
Did Cyril run by here crying in a woman's bathrobe? Well, it wouldn't surprise me.
You're driving him stark raving mad.
- What'd I do? - What'd you do? Running around all up and down this stupid blimp.
- Against the rules.
- Half-naked, tits bouncing around like you're at a rodeo, then going back to some billionaire's suite? - I was trying to stop a bomb plot.
- Oh, my God, there is no bomb! - More good news.
- And just how do you know that? Ugh.
Because I made the bomb threat! Trudy Beekman booked the very last ticket on this flight, so it was all: "Meh, meh, meh.
I'm Trudy Beekman.
I'm on the co-op board and I'm going on a blimp! Meh!" - So, yes, I made a phony bomb threat.
- Good for you.
And yet you lecture me.
Lovely.
Hello? - So, what would you say if I told you that your mother made a phony bomb threat just to get a free ride on a blimp? - I'd say that's fairly classic her? - Oh, shut up.
- And then I'd just sorta laugh at the, uh The whatchamacallit.
Irony.
There's actually a bomb on board? Archer? Archer? Oh, what the hell? Where the **** are you going? Gotta get my turtleneck.
I'm not defusing a bomb in this! - No running! Shut up! Oh, and Lana, maybe you ought to grab the Kraut.
He's the bomber.
What is this? You know what it is, Fritz! - So shut your schnitzel-hole and disarm it.
- Oh.
I get it.
The German guy mit a scar must be the bad guy.
Well, you know how I got this scar? Saving a Jewish girl from a gang of skinheads.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah! And so Krauss gets a curb party.
- Wow.
Now I feel like an asshole.
- Your words.
But could you be a lamb and disarm it anyway? Yeah, probably.
Okay, got the turtleneck and my wire cutters.
Now where are we? We're at you just shot the guy who could disarm the bomb, jackass! What? I didn't shoot him! - You think I'd bring a gun on this firetrap? - Then who did it? - I did! Captain Lammers! Nice read, Velma.
"Keep your 401 K in company stock," they said.
"The price can only go up," they said! - Well, guess what! - Um, it didn't? Who the hell wants a two-day blimp ride to London? - Which is our only route! - Okay, so it's a niche market, but Blowing it up will send the stock price down to zero.
Yeah, that's why I shorted it! - But what about all the other employees? - Um - See? It's that kinda selfish shit - Lana, no! You'll kill us all! For the last time, you idiot! It's not hydrogen it's helium! And what about that are you still not getting, exactly? Well, obviously the core concept, Lana! Sorry, I didn't go to Space Camp.
How about bomb defusal camp? No, actually lacrosse camp.
If that helps.
I mean, a lot of those skills are universal.
- Shut up.
Agent Gillette, please.
- Oh, great.
Come on people, talk to me! What are we thinking? What are we doing? - What are we wearing? - My crisis vest.
Mr.
Fatface.
- Lana? Hey, girl, are you there? - Yeah, I'm Hey, can you see me? - I see your knockoff Fiacci drawers.
- Ha-ha.
You are such a bitch.
- Hey, Ray.
- Ugh.
- Let's see that ignition, girl.
You got it? East German crap, probably a GK-31 or 32.
So on the side of the timer, there should be a serial number.
That'll tell me which wire y'all need to cut.
Got it? - Yeah, I see it! Ready? - Since first call.
- Nine, three, four T, X, S.
- T-X-X? Two X's? X- S! Like INXS! N-X-X? Jesus, use the NATO phonetic alphabet! - The what? Duh.
Christ on sale, is it S? Sierra! Ray it's niner three four, Tango, X-ray, Sierra! Thank you, doll! Now there should be a dash, followed by two letters.
- Okay.
- Okay, so now I want you to cut the blue and white wire.
- Which one? There's two of those.
- No One's blue with a white stripe and the other's white with a blue stripe.
- Yeah, and both are identical! - No! They're not! Ray? Hon? They're really similar.
One's a teeny bit Blue, honey.
- Which one? - I guess that one, maybe? - So wait, which one do I cut? - The teeny bit Blue one! Okay! - O-K? - Wait! Stop! - What? You said the letters after the dash were Oscar Kilo! - Who? - What? - O-K! Oscar Kilo! - No, "Okay!" Like: "Okay, now I'm gonna tell you what they are!" - Then you didn't! - I thought we skipped that part! - Skipped a step in disarming a bomb? - Which I thought was pretty irresponsible on your part.
- Why do you always do this? - Why do you always not shut up? - Stop.
- On the radio when we answer in the affirmative we say, "Roger.
" - Roger.
Sorry.
Ray.
- Now.
In the serial number what are the two letters following the dash? - You ready? God damn it, Archer! - First letter is B.
- Bravo.
Thanks, second letter is N.
M as in Mike, or N as - As in Nancy! God, you of all people.
- What? Archer! - Me of all people? - Nothing.
- Ray, hon.
- Okay.
- Oh, so you can say okay? - Oh, my God.
- Ray, can I shoot him? In about five seconds, honey.
Lana, be careful! Jesus, the helium! Right after he cuts the solid green wire.
- The green color is solid, or? Roger.
Oh.
Roger.
Cutting the green wire.
Archer! - Jesus, God! What? That's how annoying you are.
- Your mom's annoying! How about that? - Let's go there.
Let's go here! Where Archer shut up and cut the goddamn wire already! You shut up and I'm doing it! God! - Oh, my Ray! What's going on? - The timer sped up! - Did you cut the green one? - Yes! Roger! Steven! Whoever! - Ray! - What were the last two letters? B.
- As in butt hole.
- What do we do here? And M! As in Mancy! What? - M as in what? - Mancy! What'd you think I said? - Nancy! You idiot! Oh, yeah! I can see how Then I was like "You of all" - Exact! Same! Spot! - Ray? Ray? Tell me what to do! So do you all have parachutes? No! - That would be, you know, problem solved.
- Ray! - I don't know.
Push it off with your big-ass hands.
Good luck, honey.
- It's too heavy! - Archer? - Aah! Aah! Aah! - I can not do this alone! - You're not alone! Baby! You came back to me! Well, I really Lana, there's a lot you and I need to talk about.
And let's do that.
Right after we shove this huge bomb off the blimp! - Okay, but then we seriously need to - Cyril! - Sorry, here we go.
Lana! We're not gonna make it! - Yes, we are, Cyril! We are gonna make it.
- Ha.
Oh, my God! Lana, we made it! - Oh.
Hooray for metaphors.
I told you.
Ha-ha.
Okay, now then.
- What did you want to talk about? - Um Well, uh, a lot of stuff, really.
Starting with the fact we just bombed Ireland.
Um Pretty sure that's Wales.
Shh! Shh! - Ugh.
Why the hell is your phone on? - Because I have a social life.
- Hello? Why the hell is your phone on? Because I have a Why did you call? - Because this is important.
- Micromanagitis.
If we show San Marino the flaws in their palace security they've agreed to hire us as security consultants.
And I'm sure I don't need to remind you that we haven't gotten one of these jobs since your Uffizi fiasco.
And yet, you always do.
Because you learned nothing from it.
I learned that flammable and inflammable mean the same thing.
- Wait, what? - Well, this time make sure you Mother.
Oh, my God, we've been spotted they're shooting at us.
Oh, my - Heh.
Bet she's freaking out right now.
- Oh, my God.
What shade is that? Crack Whore Red? - You said they were tranquilizer darts.
- Ah, I merely implied that.
Damn it.
So I poisoned like, five innocent security guards? Would you relax? I'm pretty sure San Marino has universal health care.
- So? - So that's good for them.
Because there's gonna be some neurological damage.
- Oh, my.
Lana.
- Wow, that is one serious diamond.
But is it supposed to be brown? It's not brown, Pam.
- That color is called champagne.
- Mm-hm.
- And why do you have it? - Because I am gonna ask Lana to marry me.
And you're gonna give her that if she says no? Like a big "screw you in your big Lincoln-Loggy fingers"? The last thing you hear me say is, "Oh, my God, they're shooting at us" and you don't even call me back? - Well I knew you weren't in any real danger.
You know, with Lana there.
- Ha! - Ha.
And let's just knock off the giggling.
I want game-faces on those heads for our conference call with the prince.
- I thought he was a captain regent.
- Oh, whatever.
All of San Marino could fit in the South Bronx.
- The important thing is, they're loaded.
- Just shitfaced.
- Oh - About 15 freaking beers all that Schützie.
And holy shit, did I honk down a bunch of absinthe? I don't know Pam, but could you lower your voice? I must have.
Cause I hallucinated you had an engagement Not.
Another.
Word.
- And just what is this, I ask you.
- Hello, Cheryl.
Cyril.
Are you cheating on me? - No, just trying to get my muffin back.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- I'm not? - Not like that.
You gotta slug her in the diaphragm with a forearm shiver.
- Oh.
That's good to know.
Heh.
- Do it.
Um - Wow.
- Ugh.
And no muffin.
See? Time lost is muffin lost.
Along with my appetite.
- For food, that is.
Heh-heh.
- Ugh.
Come see me.
Wow.
I am incredibly sorry.
But that is my decision, Ms.
Archer.
- And as captain regent of - I don't care if you're Captain Crunch.
No, wait, Beefheart.
- We had a deal.
- Kangaroo.
Remember him? We pointed out every single flaw in your cut-rate security system.
And now not only are you hiring another agency you won't even pay ISIS for that security probe.
Which means no bonuses for us.
- Wait, what? - Oh, now he cares.
Those monies will go to medical care for the palace guards they poisoned.
- What? - Lana did that.
- And as for hiring ODIN - ODIN? - Uh, skipper, if I could jump in here.
- Trexler.
Oh, Malory.
Even on What is this, 1080p? You look just as supple and sexy as the day I first laid eyes on you.
- Where, in a wax museum? - Sterling! - That's no way to talk to your mother.
- Just who the hell do you think you are? - Getting ISIS blacklisted at the UN? - Had nothing to do with that.
- Embarrassing me in Berlin? - The entire hotel was embarrassed.
Stealing all my prospective clients? - Yeah.
- And no matter which way I turn you're butting in that big, fat, strong aquiline nose of yours.
- Wait, what? - You said it was the nose of a Caesar.
- Ehh Well, perhaps a lesser Caesar.
No, no, now, I clearly remember you said Augustus.
- And in vino veritas.
- The Chianti was definitely flowing.
- Ha, ha.
- Among other things.
- Mother.
- Hmm? Oh, uh this is the last time you make me out a fool, Len Trexler.
- You wanna play me hard? - Phrasing.
- You know I do.
- Well, then you better nut up.
- Phrasing.
- Because I've swallowed just about as much as I can take from you.
- Hey! Phrasing! And we'll see who's smirking when ISIS steals that diamond for real.
- Oh, you're a naughty girl.
- Right, then.
Commence Operation "Rub Len Trexler's Big Fat Nose In It.
" - Sounds like you already have.
- You want to break back into the palace which now has the insane amount of security we recommended? - Plus God knows how many ODIN guys.
- Yes, so take more of that poison.
And on top of that suck-salad you wanna sprinkle on the bacon bits of "Let's tell them we're coming"? - Well? - Well, there's this new thing called the element of surprise? I'm so sorry I slammed you in the gut.
Jeez, that's how Houdini died.
- Houdini died of AIDS.
- No.
Why do you always say that? And that's the thing.
- I want to surprise Lana - Well, you nailed it.
So this time I need you to not be your normal compulsively blabby self.
Wha? When have I ever been blabby? Guess who has breast cancer.
Just one of like, two dozen equally appalling videos on your website.
They're not all equally appal - And have I blabbed about you and Cheryl? - She keeps seducing me.
And you think you can make that unhappen if you give Lana a tiny flake of brown mica? - Cyril, look at it.
- But I spent two months' salary.
- I know.
But you make shit.
- Hey, I'm doing pretty well, thank you.
Save that speech for the father you continually disappoint.
I'm head of HR, Cyril, I know your take-home.
Yeah, and l I I take home shit.
Well, we all do.
What's my father ever done that's so great? School superintendent? Big whoop.
There's only like 800 kids in the entire county.
K through 12! - Wow.
- I'm sorry, you were saying? I were saying, we all make shit, so, what we should do is unionize.
Yeah.
I'll get the raise I deserve.
- Then you can buy Lana a big-boy ring.
- She'll promptly agree to marry me.
Then you take her home to meet your dick dad.
And then I shove his hawk face right into her big brown boobs and scream, "Look at those babies, old man.
Didn't need a varsity letter to get those, did I? So now who's a disappoint?" Oh, Jesus H.
Jones, Pam.
What? Carol? Carol? Oh, wait.
Cheryl? Cheryl.
Hello? Cheryl, I swear to God if I have to open my own salad again I will freak out.
Where the hell is everybody? Let's assume we can't access the palace through that same skylight.
- Okay.
- But maybe we overlooked an air shaft or maybe even some access below-grade? - So let's pull up the palace schematics.
- Uh, okay.
- Maybe today, if that works for you.
- Hang on.
- Let me see.
How about now? Anything? - No.
- Uh, how about now? - No.
- How about now? Anything? - No.
- What are you doing there? - I don't know.
- What, are you just hitting random keys? - Well, obviously.
Aw, damn it, we Where is the hobbit guy? - Heh.
A freaking hobbit works here? - No.
He's just a They're called little people, not hobbits.
- Will you He's a hobbit enthusiast.
- Ooh.
But he also knows how to work all the computers and satellites and shit.
But even though I do all that I gotta live with a roommate.
In Queens.
That's disgusting.
- Thanks, Bilbo.
Another example of how underpaid the ISIS support staff really is.
And I for one am fed up.
Yeah, fed full of muffins and denial.
What's your problem, neck bones? My problem is I remember what Ms.
Archer did to the cleaning ladies.
You sure, missus? Is plenty space.
No.
Gracias.
Okay.
Ha.
How's that for bread and roses? That was pretty sad.
What's sad is now nobody re-stocks the machine in the bathroom so I have to make my own tampons.
I don't know what that is.
That's where my yarn's going.
Exactly, and so I say, no union.
Yes, confederacy forever.
No, wait, uh-uh.
Don't listen to the makes-her-own-tampons person.
Listen to your hearts.
Because deep down you know they're exploiting us.
But if we unite, we can put a stop to it.
And that supply closet is just packed with posterboard and markers, and maybe even some glitter.
So who's with me on that picket line? - And me.
- Really? You had me at "put.
" Yes, we need a sound sensor.
Duh! Where is that equipment guy? And where the hell are the jumars? Yeah, I don't know, this was all I could find.
I'm thinking goggles, yes.
Shovels I don't know how or why we'd use them.
- Ugh.
Cheryl? - She's not in here.
- Well, why are you in here? Is the San Marino diamond in here now? It might be, for all we know.
We can't find any gear we need.
We've got no sat-coms, no new intel and so basically we are totally unprepared for this mission.
- Unless it involves night-shoveling.
- Well, I want that diamond.
Not to mention my rapidly-approaching- room-temperature Cobb salad, so Damn it, where the hell are all the drones? What do we want? Unfair! When do we want it? Change! Okay, so they're bad chanters, but overall this strike's shaping up.
- How? Nobody knows why we're striking.
- Well, we can't say "Hey, right upstairs is a top-secret intelligence agency.
" But it looks like we're picketing the cleaners.
- No, it doesn't.
- Jesus! Stop picketing the cleaners! You were saying? - Why are people picketing the cleaners? - I predicted this.
It's curry fury.
Holy shit, is that Cyril? And Pam, Krieger, Carol.
All the Drones.
They're not picketing the cleaners, they're picketing ISIS.
- What's their beef? - Oh, the same entitled crap as always.
"I can't make ends meet," "I'm on food stamps.
" "My child died because I couldn't afford new bone marrow.
" - Just me, me, me.
- Jesus, whose kid died? Oh, who remembers.
Check Pam's blog.
And done, but if you still want us to steal you that gigantic diamond - Well, obviously.
- We're gonna have to cross their picket line.
- Screw that.
- Yeah, what's with all the bottles? It's like a trailer park Easter.
Lousy commies! Go back to Quebec! Jesus.
Okay, strike's over, everybody.
No, hold that line.
We deserve a raise and Lana deserves a real ring, so Okay, so let's go out the back.
- Oh, my God.
- Ha, ha! - Happy Easter, Cyril.
- Lana? Oh, baby.
What happened to you? - Well, see, I wanted to buy you a - Cyril.
- This is not that moment.
- And we don't talk to management.
- Or ham-fisted whores.
- What? - Hmm? - Yeah, no, they're right.
- What? - No, not the whore part.
Management.
We're not technically management.
But you make shitloads more than we do.
Even though you totally depend on us.
On you? Hey, we're out there risking our lives every - Many of the days.
- And so, yes, we get paid a little more.
- How much a little more? - Well, it's complicated.
- No, it isn't, don't answer that.
- What with salary performance incentives, bonuses - Bonuses? - Dump her, Cyril.
Hey, crazy.
Go macrame some tampons.
Oh, you wanna hear something crazy? Cyril - Thank you, Pam.
Now look, Lana - Baby, "Take Charge" Cyril is totally doing it for me, it really is, but we're on a vital mission here.
- Vital mission? - Not on the master clipboard.
- So just how vital is it? It's incredibly vital.
Because if they don't steal me that huge diamond I will literally die.
- A diamond? - In this economy? - You're stealing a diamond? For her? - Oh, irony.
- And the rest of you, back to work.
If that salad isn't open in the next - Get them! - Oh, oh! - Hey, whoa.
- Stop surging.
Archer, do something.
I am doing something.
What are you doing? Lana, out the back.
Move.
Hey, Cyril.
Cyril.
- Cyril! What? I'm saving Lana.
As usual.
Hey, shut up.
Freaking ODIN.
I can't believe this.
How many are there? About a jillion.
Damn it.
- A jillion gay little copycats.
- What? I didn't invent the turtleneck, Lana.
But I was the first to recognize its potential as a tactical garment.
- The tactical turtleneck, Lana.
- Archer.
The Tactleneck.
- Can you please focus? - Not really.
Don't think these goggles were properly calibrated.
Ditto the sound sensor.
And the stupid code-cloner.
All the gear those sweaty tech-dweebs normally Oh! - Do we take the drones for granted? - No.
No, no, Lana.
Do not make this about them.
No, no, no.
That is utterly unacceptable.
- It's just a cost-of-living adjustment.
It's strong-arm robbery.
Come on, Ms.
Archer.
You've been in there ten hours.
Meet us halfway, and Krieger will let you out of there.
- Or else he'll crank up the heat again.
I love that you know how to do that.
- And I love that I have an erection that didn't involve homeless people.
And you're cool with Krieger shucking your side-corn? Yeah, that is a huge win-win for me.
You hear that, Ms.
Archer? We're all on board for the big win-win out here.
Well, I'm not.
Do your worst, Krieger.
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, yes.
Yes, go ahead.
Crank up the heat.
I'm as naked as the day I was born.
Oh, yes.
That is not something - Naked or not.
- Well, don't keep saying it.
You can't stay in there forever.
Ha! I'll outlast you.
I'm naked and I've got half a lime and almost nearly two-thirds of a half-gallon of Shit.
- Now we got her.
Ha! I'll suck it straight off this grimy linoleum before I give in to you belly-achers.
- You've got nothing! - No code-cloner, no GPS.
Argh! - We've got no thermal imaging.
- Lana we don't need gadgets.
- Really? Machines are gonna fail.
Then the system's gonna fail and then it's "Who has the ability to survive?" And that's the game, Lana.
Survival.
Just watched Deliverance again, huh? I mean, is Burt Reynolds not the man in that? On the raft? With the vest? - Huh? You know he did all his own stunts.
- I know! - Shh! - He did his own stunts! Keep your freaking voice Aah! God! Sweet Jesus, the goggles! Intruders.
Get them.
- Aah, Lana! Lana, I'm blind.
I'm blind.
- Yeah? Should I go on without you? What? No, carry me, monster-hands.
Ow, ow, ow! Jesus.
Quit bouncing my eyes.
Shut up.
I'm trying to get us an evac but nobody's answer Oh, holy shit, are they still on strike? Hey, Eugene Debs, it's only been about ten hours.
- All right? - So you'd rather die in there than give us a cost-of-living adjustment? Yes.
- Well, I can arrange that.
Crunch! I love that you know how to do that.
Well, now you're trapped.
Happy? Yes.
- Ugh! Laundry.
Oh, wait, are we open? What? Sir, you have to slow Jeezy Petes, get a load of this guy.
We're taking heavy fire and we need an extraction, dumb-ass! Lana? Ha! She thought you were a man.
Shut up.
Cyril, baby we're pinned down, okay? We need a Aah! - Lana! What's going on? We need evac.
A helo, a jump-jet.
At this point, really anything.
Don't just stand there, idiots.
- Yeah, come on.
Get them out of there.
Uh, we need the sat-com link to do that.
- So? - So it's upstairs.
And, uh, someone broke the elevator.
And Miss Fire Hazard in there bricked up the only stairwell.
Don't talk to me about fire hazards.
- All you people did in there was smoke.
Oh, God, I'm hit.
Lana! - Will somebody please do something? Like what, Cyril? I'm blind.
- No, us.
Here.
Oh.
- Krieger, Bilbo.
Come on, can't you guys do something? Wha? No.
Oh, wait, I meant yes.
Roger that, Zebra-Two.
Stand by.
Helo's 10-4, just needs you to upload their GPS coordinates into his HUD.
Which I will do with these cell phones.
Holy shit, you geeks are bad-ass.
We couldn't have done it without an electrical insulator.
So thank Cyril for the tiny brown diamond.
What? Wait, did we get the diamond? What? No.
But Cyril, why did you have a diamond? Oh, uh, just my ear-stud.
You know, from college.
Really? Called it.
And, again, you do realize it'll be totally destroyed in the process.
Yes, just hurry up.
Please.
Okay, uploading GPS coordinates.
- Wait a second.
Damn it, we don't have a second.
Lana, I'm sure we have one second.
But seriously, it does sound like we're about to be overrun, so Get my son out of there.
What the hell are you people waiting for? - A goddamn cost-of-living adjustment.
What? - Hey, yeah.
- No! - Krieger, this is not the time for this.
- It is exactly the time.
So, what's it gonna be, you harpy? You ever wanna see your son again? Not at the number you quoted me.
Mother! - That number is pegged to the consumer price index.
Where? The People's Republic of Canada? Jesus, take it out of our bonuses.
What? Mother, no, listen to me.
Aah! I'm hit.
I'm hit and I'm blind.
Jesus, Ms.
Archer, your child is dying.
Oh, all right.
If they'll give up their bonuses Mother! You can have your lousy cost-of-living adjustment.
Something good's happening.
And you can have your dick son back.
What's going on? I hear a helicopter.
- Oh, yeah.
Holy shit my other senses are already heightened.
- Hey, this time I saved Lana.
- But Oh, God, Pam.
Two months' salary.
- Cyril.
You can't put a price on good pussy.
Roger that, Zebra Two.
Hey, the helo's got them.
They're safe.
Hooray.
Way to go.
Then get me out of this sweat-box! Because I am officially out of gin.
Oh, come on, Archer, not now, I'm serious.
Hey, I'm serious! Look at me, seriously, Lana.
Forget the eye bandage, but the hair, the strong jaw line.
- Who do I remind you of? - Nobody.
- Say it.
- Don't make me do that.
- Say it.
Say it! - Ugh.
Burt Reynolds in Deliverance.
No! Not in Deliverance.
Ha, ha.
- In Gator.
- Ugh.
Right? How can you not see that?
Because this is what was there, Lana! There, where? Outside a clown college? - They have those here? - I don't know! Archer, look out! - We'll never catch him! - You should have thought about that before you blew the damn drop! - I blew jack shit! - Name dropper.
And if you weren't so busy trying to bang that waitress you'd have noticed that ODIN had agents in play! She was the hostess! If you weren't blinded by jealousy - Yes, I'm jealous.
- First step's admitting it.
Jealous that ODIN's gonna beat us again thanks to your epic poon-houndery! - First of all - Oh! Oh, my God.
- Great, good job.
Shut up! ODIN doesn't beat Sterling Archer.
Only Sterling Archer beats Did you wanna finish that? Did you wanna finish shutting your big fat, negative-wordsy mouth? Whose fat mouth told the stupid waitress he was an ISIS agent? Hostess.
And I had a plan.
- What, to get laid in the walk-in? - Also.
Because I'm not an ant, Lana.
- I happen to see the big picture.
- Oh, really? Well, then where's Kasparov? Okay, that was a fluke.
Ha, ha.
Yeah, a fluke of nature.
Because I happen to have perfect situational awareness, Lana.
- Archer.
- Which cannot be taught, by the way.
Archer.
- Like a poet's mind for - Archer.
- Archer! - To make the perfect word.
- Archer! - Goddamn it, I'm relishing the - Ow.
Way to go, Lana.
Nice warning.
- Nice relishing.
Ow.
- Oh.
Think that was ODIN? - No, it's only you that beats you, buddy.
Hey, gang.
Barry.
Gee, thanks for helping us catch Kasparov.
- ODIN appreciates the assist.
Yeah.
And if you ever get tired of playing JV ball you know where to find us.
- Oh, yeah, uh, where's that? Um, dick town? Ha, ha.
Jesus, even their cards are nice.
Lana, look at this.
It's embossed.
Oh, okay.
Then, I guess, just pout.
- That was the mayor of Paris - Name dropper.
- Who was just as eager as I am to know why ISIS agents were terrorizing Paris! - So I crashed a few cop cars ran over a few mimes! So I don't play by the rules, Mother, but I get results! Well, as long as you got Kasparov.
Oh, uh, yeah, about that That's why she can't have nice things.
- Either that or I steal them.
What? - Hm? What's that? Hm? What do you want? I'm a little busy for chitchat.
- Busy trying to turn that thing on? - Look at this! - O-N.
Nothing.
- Well, just keep at it.
- You're not my supervisor! I'm sorry, what? He sort of offered me a job at ODIN.
- Barry Dillon? - Uh Barry "We have this whole huge history together" Dillon? We don't have this whole huge history.
- Oh.
Oh, my God.
Barry.
- Oh, yeah, right.
Pretty sweet, huh? Using a mirror to reflect the laser beam back into the laser? - Oh, my God! - Yeah, sorry, it took so long.
- And that I'm accidentally inside you.
- Not a problem.
- But - I just wanna keep my options open! So you can't breathe a word of this to Malory.
You know how she gets.
ODIN? - Well, since I'm not appreciated here What's to appreciate? Exactly! That's indicative of your whole attitude, Mother! Sterling Malory Archer, you are of course free to pursue your options.
- My Wait, hang on.
And if ODIN made you a better offer, what kind of mother would I be if I stood in the way of your happiness? Uh Wait, what just happened here? Fine! She thinks I won't go? Well, guess what! - I don't need her! - I, however, do need your keycard.
Yeah, hi, Barry Dillon please? Yes, I'll hold! Oh, and just wait till I get to ODIN.
I will.
Keycard? - Oh.
Here! God! - They are the stuff-throwingest family.
Okay, so after I call your vase guy Freeze every one of his accounts! And then get me Woodhouse.
And we'll just see how tough Sterling is when he can't suckle at my teat! - Ugh.
Woodhouse, she froze my accounts and I need to get in my safe, so open the goddamn door already! I'm afraid I can't since ISIS actually pays the rent on the Aah! Damn it! When did we get a bulletproof door? After the Popeye incident, sir.
Oh, right.
Wait, so you kick me out of my own house? Yes, sir.
Although it pains me dearly.
I'm gonna pain you dearly, Woodhouse! When I peel all your skin off with a flensing knife, sew it into Woodhouse pajamas and then set those pajamas on fire! - Hello? - It's just you and me now, Reggie.
So be a lad, put on some Mingus.
Hi, Barry Dillon, please? Yes, it's Sterling Archer Oh.
Yes, I'll hold! Oh, come on! We've got Ml6 in the semis on Sunday and I am slicing it like a butcher.
- Just keep at it.
- I think it's this new grip.
- So listen.
Remember how you wanted me to float that job offer to Lana Kane? - Love her, yeah.
When does she start? - Right? That's the thing.
See, I think Sterling Archer thought I was talking to him.
- Archer? You're kidding! I wish.
I mean, obviously the guy's great in the field.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Well, you would know.
- Now, see.
Why do you do that? Why do you softball them in like that? - I'm sorry, how's the leg? - Hurts when it rains.
And when I think about Archer, and so I blew him off.
No, no, no, Barry, you blow him on! - "On" as in hire him? As in here? - Yes! It'll drive his mother crazy.
Gotta be the grip.
And you froze all of Sterling's accounts? - Domestic and foreign? - Even the one on the Isle of Man.
Oh, my God, is that, like, Whore Island for women? - No.
- Then you just watch, in no time he'll be begging me to take him back.
- He hasn't called, has he? - No.
How you holding up, Mama Bird? Well, except for your grossly over-familiar tone, I couldn't be happier.
- Even if Mr.
Archer gets a job at ODIN? - Oh, please.
ODIN won't hire him.
After the stunt he pulled in Berlin? Well, whose fault is that, Barry? Yours.
You bust in, shoot two good double agents And you think an appropriate response is to ruin my suit? - Oh, and my shirt.
- I'm sorry.
So will you please just help me up? - No.
- For which I am pretty genuinely sorry.
Nothing two steel rods and 16 titanium screws couldn't fix.
- Come on, don't be shitty.
- Yeah, Barry.
- It's water under the bridge.
- Yeah, Barry.
- Because he's part of the family now.
- So go put his stuff in his office.
- Yeah, Barry.
Barry, hi.
So I was wondering if your tempting offer was still open.
No, you silly man.
About the job.
No, just keeping my options open.
Definitely come in.
I mean, we did kind of fill the position but I don't know if it's gonna be a good fit.
I just don't see why you need this.
Because this is a huge opportunity for me and I need to feel confident.
In the interview? - Uh-huh.
- Oh, that looks great.
Yeah, it feels pretty good.
- So come on already, take a cut.
- What, like, out the window? Don't worry about it.
I get a deal on those, 90 cents a ball.
Um, okay.
God, you're a natural.
- Bet it's all that lacrosse at boarding school.
- Yeah, 13 years' worth.
Thirteen years? What, she ship you off in kindergarten? - Ahem.
Gosh, that must've been tough.
- No, l I loved it.
Um Made a lot of good friends.
Family, almost, is what they were.
Speaking of, how's your mother taking all this? Oh, please, I bet she doesn't even miss me.
Because he'll be back, crying for his mommy.
Just like that Christmas break when I moved and forgot to give my new address to his stupid boarding school.
I mean, he rode the train into the city all by himself.
He couldn't pick up a phone book? Nine years old, and bawling in that police station like a little girl.
- Ha! What's that tell you? - Kind of a lot, actually.
Oh, shut up.
I bet you're barren.
- My God.
On Christmas? - Well, Christmas Eve, technically.
Well, the lovely Framboise from HR has some paperwork for you to sign.
So why don't you follow her on down to your big new corner office.
- Okay.
Where the sofa is soaked in Scotchgard.
- It, uh - lf you know what I mean.
- Yeah, I think I do.
- It's resistant to stains.
- Right, right, I got it.
- Super.
Because we're one big family.
Ugh.
- Why do you make that sound? - Gee, let's see.
You're off to interview with ODIN home of Barry "Oh, I forgot to mention the naked laser thing" Dillon.
ODIN isn't some co-ed freshman dorm where everyone runs around screwing.
I'm sorry, Framboise, it's not you.
I mean, it's not me, either, obviously.
But in the office - You don't sex on the women at ISIS? - Constantly, but you know, it's not allowed.
It's probably illegal.
- But here - Here we are one big famille.
Yeah, and the, uh, famille thing actually makes this borderline creepy.
- Perhaps if you tried it from behind? - Yeah, let's try that.
Don't get any on that snappy suit.
Don't you have better things to do than mince around and gawk? About a million.
But Cheryl was scared to come in here so I took time out of my busy mincing schedule to tell you that you have a phone call.
- Is it Sterling? - I am sure I don't know.
- Do you know you're a little bitch? - Will you remember this conversation? - Probably not, no.
- Well, then **** off.
Whoa, whoa with the language.
You kiss your mother with that mouth? You leave Bub out of this.
And how dare you steal my son away from me? - Steal him? You cut him loose.
- You cut him loose! - What? - I want you to fire him, this instant.
No, no, I can't do that.
He's happy here, he's making new friends.
- Goddamn it, Archer! - What, Barry? I said don't come in here.
Framboise, what'd I say? - He said do not come in.
- Yeah, Barry.
- I don't care if he's happy.
- That's obvious.
- Meaning what, exactly? - Meaning, who leaves a 9-year-old kid in a police station on Christmas? - Eve.
- And he told you about that? - Oh, we've had such great talks.
- Fire him! - Join him.
Come work for me.
- Have you lost your mind? - Every time I see you.
- Fire him.
- Can't do it.
Can't or won't? - Either? - Fine.
Then go check your Telex.
- Oh, my God.
A burn notice? Look at that.
"ISIS disavows Agent Sterling Archer, a.
k.
a.
Duchess.
" - Man, she loved that dog - "Who is to be considered an unreliable asset and security risk.
" Oh, it must have killed her to do this.
- Ha, ha.
And I'm smirking.
- No, you don't smirk at a mother's suffering, Barry, you asshole! Ow! It's just, with the shattered femur, and the gunshot wound and I don't know if you knew this, but Framboise and I were kind of engaged.
- I did not know that.
- Yeah.
- And I served her up like a pudding.
- Barry.
- Well, engaged to be engaged.
Ow! Ass.
If you love it, put a ring on it.
Okay, so you go fix this.
You know, I'm not even sure I want to now.
- She was obviously into him.
Mother - Ass.
- Not Framboise.
Archer.
- The burn notice? His mother just sent that to To every agency on the planet.
Look: CIA, Ml6, Interpol.
- We can't keep him now, Barry.
- Oh.
So So you take him to the basement, you put one in his ear.
- Can you do that? - Oh, my God.
- That Framboise is a freak, huh? - Yeah.
Yeah, I can do that.
No, as a matter of fact I don't have Barry on speed dial.
Well, that's rather surprising.
Know what's surprising? Kissing you at the airport dozing off in first class, then seeing you on my flight when I get up to pee! - That, to me, is rather surprising.
- And really expensive, turns out.
- Just - Ha, ha.
Seriously.
I mean, I don't wanna sound like a jerk but that Framboise chick must have been a prostitute before she got this gig.
- In, like, Bangkok.
- Ahem.
I was almost embarrassed for her.
- Where we going? - We are heading down to sub-basement three.
- Is there a shower? Because I bet I just, like, reek of her.
- One second.
Dillon.
- Oh, Barry, you getting that? - Really? - I'm brushing it your way, Barry.
No, I'm actually at the lobby right now.
Two seconds.
- So wait, where are we on that shower? - Head on back up to your office.
There's actually a private bathroom in there.
Oh, good.
Because, like I said, I bet I just reek.
Yeah, you've mentioned that.
No.
Baby, I am putting you in the corner where you will sit quietly.
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.
- And who are you? Cyril Figgis, ISIS comptroller and And very eager to sit here quietly in the corner because he is so tired.
Um, so I'll just be here, then? - Yeah? - Yeah.
No, no, no! Who put out a burn notice on Sterling? - That would be you.
- What? - Ha-ha-ha.
Holy shit, the look on your face.
- But I would never.
Not in a million Get a mirror.
- Oh, dear God, did I drink absinthe? - That bottle and most of this one.
- Until we wrestled it away from you.
Because you don't know how to share, beyotch.
- Easy, tough guy.
- I don't remember any of that.
Absinthe makes me black out.
All right, you yellow sons of bitches.
Let's dance.
- It also makes you incredibly mean.
- And ugly.
- Seriously.
Danger zone.
- Beyotch.
- Well, don't just sit there.
Undo this.
- Ooh.
- "Ooh" what? - We can't, Ms.
Archer.
It's too late.
- I'm sorry, so, what are you saying? - I, uh - Can you not give me a minute? - No.
You fire me, I take my things.
Take all the things! Here, take this! Go staple my heart back together! How am I the bad guy in this? - So, Barry.
- Huh? That was Framboise, our head of HR.
- With whom I guess I won't be meeting? - No, she's gone.
And so, remember how I said we'd just hired someone? - Yes.
- And so remember Sterling Archer? Wait, wait, wait, Lana.
Barry, if you touch me, I swear to God I will put you in the ground.
That was before his mother put out a burn notice on him.
What? Malory burned Archer? - Worldwide.
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, so he's gone.
- Already? Like, literally gone? Oh, my God.
I liked her better mean.
He's gone.
I killed my baby boy and now my baby is gone! - Oh, now, you can always - Always what? Well, I was gonna say you can have another baby but you're all dried up in there.
No, no, no, like, figuratively gone.
Unlike Framboise whose car should be blowing up any minute.
- Oh! Ooh-la-la! Uh May I help you avec your box? - So Archer's still here? - Yeah, he's in that corner office.
And once Facilities cleans his brains out of it it can be your office.
- Really? I don't think the cleaning staff does brains.
I mean, you shoot him and I get an office overlooking the Champs-Elysées? - And the bank where you'll drive your new company car to deposit your insane paychecks and maybe, if you stand on those tiptoes, your huge apartment.
- Huge as in? - As in you won't see your live-in servants unless you really want to.
Let me go shoot this prick.
- Wait.
Let me do it.
- Really? - Because I would kind of love to.
- Not as much as I would.
- You guys kind of have a history, huh? - Yeah, you could say that.
- Knock yourself out.
- These servants, if I did see them would they curtsy meekly? - Heh.
Well, otherwise, what's the point? Archer! Come on.
Lana, why the hell are? Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lana, no! Barry, does this make up for Framboise? It does, Other Barry, it sure does.
Barry? I guess, go ahead and call Facilities or whatever.
Because there is lamp everywhere.
- God, Lana! Get on with your life already! - Oh! - Telex.
You got one in here? - Why, so you can smash that too? - No.
- I'm pretty sure I'm financially responsible for the furnishings.
- So I can send a telex from ODIN to make the burn notice from your mother look like an ODIN black flag.
- Mother burned me? - Apparently.
Oh, my God, that's classic her.
You're both classic her.
Shut up, get dressed and grab the keys to that car.
We've got about two minutes before some ODIN dick sees this and seals the exits.
Any way we can bump that to five? - I need a shower.
- Archer! Okay, God.
Climb down off that rag.
Oh, my God, looks like Jonestown in here.
Yes, Pam.
Get me some poison.
Because I am already dead inside.
Too dead inside to read good news? - Is it my obituary? - Well, it's not that good.
Give me that, you oaf! "All agencies disregard ISIS burn notice on Agent Archer a.
k.
a.
Duchess.
" An ODIN black flag operation! Pam, he's alive.
My Sterling is alive.
Oh.
And look at happy little Mama Bird.
Well, the blowback on ODIN for this will be huge.
- And I saw it coming.
I knew it.
- Uh-huh.
Just like I knew Sterling would come crying back to mommy wiping his snotty nose on his sleeve like a scared little boy on Christmas.
- Uh-huh.
Eve.
It was only Christmas Eve.
- I know.
Good to have you back.
And? - And? - And do you just plan to loom over me all day, like some sort of henge? - Okay.
Well, you see? This is why.
This is why we can't have nice things.
Barry, you asshole! - How am I the bad guy in this? - Because I wanted this, Archer.
I'm sick of you getting the best assignments just because your mother is the boss.
Do you know what that's like? - Besides awesome? - Oh! - Hang on, I think my car's on P-2.
- Well, I have to get Cyril, who's on - Framboise, hello.
- Hello.
Oh, man.
That's bad.
Yes, now.
Let's talk this out.
Talk what out? How you ruined my chance to work for ODIN? Or, ooh, maybe how I just caught my boyfriend balls-deep in some French chick.
- Ex-boyfriend, I bet.
- You think? - Yeah, he's not coming back.
That chick was like the Pele of anal.
- Archer? - Sorry, I know this is tough.
I mean, Cyril, whatever, but your feelings for me are obviously conflicted You're right, Archer, I am conflicted.
Because if I had shot you in the face, I'd be living here.
- Getting curtsied at by servants.
- Yeah, but you couldn't do it.
Maybe we both belong at ISIS, you know? - Maybe that's our real home.
- That's what Mother said about boarding school.
And really, sorry about Cyril.
- Me too.
- Even if you brought it on yourself.
- Excuse me? - Oh, come on, I don't recall ever seeing a welcome mat at your back door.
- Archer.
But wait, would that cheer you up? Me and you, a little revenge-anal? - Archer? - Yes? - You wearing a seatbelt? - Uh, no, why? So, uh, is that a yes, or a maybe, or? What? Oh, okay.
Then, I guess, just pout.
And that's your message? My God.
Who? Who's there? What do you want? Because all you're gonna get is holes.
L I mean, holes in you not my Hah! Sterling? - Hello, Mother.
- Where the hell have you been? - I don't know.
- What? And why do you have a cleaver? "Interoffice fraternization of an intimate nature is prohibited to include but not limited to trysts, assignations" What's this even mean? It means no more banging coworkers.
Oh, so it doesn't affect you.
Mee-hee.
Oh, wait, guess what.
Ow! Hey, this isn't my fault.
It's exactly your fault, idiot.
When Mother found out you cheated on Lana - Hey, you cheated on Lana plenty.
- Yeah, but with starlets, models.
Oh, and one time, two actual princesses.
- Two at the same time? - Yeah, they were sisters.
- Sploosh.
- Cyril, you threw Lana away on chicks like - Like Carol.
- It's Cheryl.
- Exactly, back me up here.
- You slept with her too.
When I was bored.
Like, stuck at home waiting for the cable guy, or Oh, hey.
What are you doing Thursday between 9 and noon? - Ugh.
- One and 4? I'll be doing one of your co-workers.
Well, do it before quitting time Friday.
- Why'd Ms.
Archer give us until Friday? - I did that.
Somebody in this building is gonna have sex with me.
Yeah? You think between now and Friday you can score some roofies? - Heh-heh-heh.
Uh-uh.
Pam? I will end you.
Ow! Where the hell is my staple gun? I think I saw Cyril with it.
- He went through my desk? - I guess.
I mean he said he did.
I don't know why I'm surprised.
I mean, can you believe him? - Cheating on Lana? - Baffling.
Said the kettle.
Which is why I started that new policy.
- Yeah? - You idiots run around here like it's spring break on South Padre.
- Just sex, sex, sex - Sexy-sexy, eh? Nikolai? - Is from Frederick's of Latvia.
- Mother? What? - Oh, hello, son.
- Nikolai.
- Why did he call me "son?" - What is this? - You mean besides incredibly awkward? No, I think "incredibly awkward" just about sums it up.
What? Mother! Nikolai, could I call you back? I will be here maybe in one hour then I'll try to hit gym, so - The gym.
That'll be the day.
Are you out of your mind? I must be.
Because it looks like you just destroyed my Steuben bar set.
- Well, you just destroyed my innocence.
- Oh, please, that Brazilian au pair did that when you were 13.
- 12.
And why does Nikolai Jakov the head of the KGB, have a direct line to your office? Well, you know, from time to time What? No.
Just leave that, you'll cut yourself.
Sterling.
And a follow-up question: Why did he just call me son? - That's often a figure of speech.
- Yeah? How often? Very often.
Just not in this case.
I know Uh What? Terrific.
Two Steuben glasses left and you break one.
I'm sorry, Krieger, but it's over.
So here's all your Creedence Clearwater albums back.
- Now a sad moon is on the rise.
- I know, devastating.
But it's not you, it's your weak, womanny hands.
- They're not - It's like being choked by a child.
Which I thought would be hot, but - Wait, no, I'll take steroids.
- I can't wait.
I need a man now with monster-hands.
- Oh, like Lana ha Hey, you.
You know, the whole "monster-hands" thing? Starting to border on mean.
Oh, you gonna run cry to Ms.
Archer, like when Cyril cheated on you? - Hello.
- Ooh-la-la.
Well, at least my ex-boyfriend isn't a noose I made out of extension cord.
Guess what.
She wasn't the only one Cyril cheated with.
- And what is that supposed to mean? - Figure it out, Truckasaurus.
Oh, that gives me an idea.
But I already have a father.
His name was John Fitzgerald Archer.
He was a fighter ace, and he won the Navy Cross.
- And his men called him - "Black Jack" Archer.
I know, dear, I know, because I made it all up.
But the military funeral.
Ready.
Aim.
Oh, my God.
- Lf we miss that train I will go blind.
Fire.
But the 21 gun salute.
I donated 600 bucks to a Junior ROTC team up in Yonkers.
Which they used to go to a competition in Albany where they won third place.
So a lot of good came out of that.
- So all's well that ends well? - What was I to do? Tell a 3-year-old his father might be in the KGB? What? What do you mean might be? So there may or may not be a few other possibles in the mix.
What? Seriously? You cheated on me with Carol? - Cheryl.
- Exactly.
- And I can explain that.
- Well if you'd let me.
Yeah, tell me.
How my father might be Nikolai Jakov head of the KGB or Len Trexler, head of ODIN! - Well - I assume those are my only choices? Oh, my Who else? - Gene Krupa.
No, wait.
- What? The drummer? Not Krupa, the other one, with the teeth.
- Buddy Rich.
- Oh, my - I could never say no to a drummer.
- Could you say no to anybody? I said no to plenty.
- No.
No.
- Yes.
Have sex with me.
Please.
- No.
- Oh, come on.
- Nobody would ever know.
- Pam? Yeah.
- I'd know.
No.
- Let me talk to him.
- No.
No.
Nikolai, he's not even here.
He stormed out, thanks to you.
But I could talk sense into him.
After all, I am his father.
Oh.
So Len Trexler or Buddy Rich? - Get me that crazy German.
Now.
- Ow! Ow! - Hostile work environment.
- Shut up.
We are going to kidnap Agent Sterling Archer.
Oh, yeah? Then what, you hurt his feelings? Then we put new mind-control microchip into his brain.
We use its remote-control capability to bring him here, make the papa test.
And if I am Archer's father I turn him against his own mother, as Soviet agent.
Make him a, how you say, vole.
- I think you mean mole.
Mole.
- Huh? Vole is also rodent, but more closer related to lemming.
Come on, buddy.
Can't you read, ass-douche? You're not supposed to be here without a kid.
As it happens, I am here with a child.
Mani, can we have more money for the sweets? What? That's not even a real baby.
And that is? I thought you were off to the fair with your prize turnip.
- A tur? Listen, you kraut puke.
- Hello.
Oh, yeah.
You should go.
You're lucky his father's not here.
He knows krav maga, he'll kick your balls through your hat you Nazi shit ass.
- Mani, these people.
Well, you wanted him to grow up in the city.
Nein, major, not you.
Yeah, listening.
And after you take Archer to the KGB safehouse on Gansevoort you will implant the microchip into his brain.
- Got it.
Yeah, seriously.
Okay, Uta, we have a job, so Where is the diaper bag? - I forgot where I put it.
- Huge surprise.
- Ow! Ow! - Idiot.
What is wrong with you? And just who the happy hell do you think you are, hanging up on me? Oh, you gonna tell your boyfriend, Len Trexler? - Or maybe Gene Krupa? - It was the other one.
Maybe.
Or you, maybe, or Whoever it was, he wasn't there to raise Sterling, so I don't need him butting in now.
- We'll see.
Nothing.
- What? Nikolai, what are you scheming at? - Nothing.
- Again he hangs up on me.
And there goes the last Steuben.
- Sploosh.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Yup, yup, yup.
Wait, you think it's safe? No.
Okay, we got the French chick, and Carol and anybody else, Rambone? - No.
Hi, Cyril.
- Well.
Um - Scatterbrain Jane? Really? Well, say she had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.
Oh, right.
I forgot, your dick's full of radiation and mastectomy coupons.
Boy, you are just so determined not to be cool about this.
- Yup.
Anybody else? - Um Ms.
Archer, you're trying to seduce me.
Aren't you? - Nope, no, no one.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, get out.
- Of my own office? - Yup.
- Why? Oh, you don't wanna be here when I bang every last dude in the building.
- What? - Here on your blotter.
- No! - Yup! - You can't do that.
- Really? Is it Opposite Day already? Uh Attention? Hi, this is Agent Kane and if you wanna have ball-slappy sex with me on Cyril's desk please line up and take a number.
You heard the lady.
Take a number.
Eighty-sixed? Uh-uh.
You don't eighty-six me.
Because my dad won the Navy Cross.
- Here's the door.
- Help.
Please help me.
My baby.
He swallowed something, he's choking.
Oh, who gives a shit about a baby? Who would want to raise a child here? - Well, that was a huge waste of time.
- I said don't take your clothes off.
- Well.
Well! - Begged, even.
Okay, this is good to go.
- So was this.
- So let's get number two in here.
- You really think this is gonna work? - Pam, look at me.
Yeah Sploosh.
Now serving number two.
I'm two.
- That's me! Move, dude.
- Animals.
- You're all just animals.
- Lying in wait at the watering hole taut buttocks all aquiver, just aching to pounce on the supple brown flesh of your woman.
- Shut up.
- They're gonna mess her up.
- Why are you even here? - Hello.
- But you're gay.
- Girl, please.
Nobody's that gay.
- Wait, what? - What, what? What part of you pay me 600 dollars do you not get? The part where we don't have sex? You get to say we did.
Which is, like, half the reason men have sex.
But that's a lot of money.
- Not compared to rotator cuff surgery.
- What? Which you're gonna need after the jillion high-fives you give your little bros.
- Okay, I'm in.
- But first guy you tell is Cyril.
- And make up the sickest - Yeah, shut up, do you take plastic? - Five percent discount for cash.
- I thought it was ten.
Oh, oh, oh, I can't wet my beak? Hey, seriously, kidnappers super not in the mood for this right now.
Or that.
What is that? Is that a drill? - Okay, so.
I don't want that.
- I make a klein hole in his skull with this.
Just shut that off.
- Then into the hole I smoosh this.
What is that? And then they can control his brain.
But is Soviet technology so it's a crapshoot.
- This is amazing, no? What is amazing is we just ran into him on the street.
- It's a huge city.
- Hey.
Hey! Proposition.
First person to untie me, guy or gal I will let him or her give me a handy.
Ugh.
- Let's share the milk of human kindness.
- What an asshole.
- Don't worry, your time is coming.
- Wait, by time do you mean me? And by "don't worry", do you mean the chick's gonna be doing the handy? And either way, can we do it without that thing? Hey, seriously.
Give me a hanjo.
It doesn't work.
I drill hole in head of man who maybe is my son.
Put chip in his brain and now you tell me it doesn't work.
You should have asked me before, you See, in testing we have had teensy problem with signal from satellite.
When it is in small window just over the target it can signal the chip.
But when it exits this window.
- Ahh.
- This problem does not sound teensy! It is compared to the problem we had with interference from cell phones.
Which in lab sent test subjects into ferocious homicidal rages.
So obviously we need to tweak it.
Damn that crazy, jealous Russian.
Bet he's hatching some half-assed, vodka-soaked scheme to Hello? Ha! - Sterling? Sterling, listen very Wha? Voicemail.
You know what to do.
We're sorry.
- Damn it.
Carol? Carol.
And just where the hell is she? - Oh, God, sorry.
Sorry.
- Ahh - What are you doing? - I thought you said start slacking off.
Not slacking off.
Dude, swear to God.
She gave me a Jane Hathaway.
Right on my chest.
My man knows what I'm talking about.
Doesn't anyone work around here? And Cyril I am so disgusted with you right now I just wanna vomit.
That's exactly what I said to Lana.
Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven.
Ooh.
- Uh Move.
Ugh.
Just get it done by Friday.
Oh, come on Sterling, pick up, pick Sterling? Sterling? What's wrong, are you in? Ha.
Alternate voicemail.
- You know what to do, stupid.
We're sorry I'm done.
He's dead to me.
Mother.
Kill Mother.
Oh, my God, I'm exhausted.
Whereas I am merely confused.
If you told every guy the same thing then they all know that none of them had sex with you.
- They're all gonna realize they're all lying.
- Hey, yeah.
- Wait a minute.
- But remember, they're dudes.
- What? - Um - I had sex with Lana.
- Me too.
- Lana Kane, you magnificent bastard.
- Mwah.
- I just hope Cyril don't, like, snap.
- Cyril? Snap? - Snap.
- Girl, please.
Seven, six, two, millimeter full metal jacket Someone's in here.
Holy shit snacks.
You made over 20 grand.
Minus my sixty bucks.
Plus Cyril's broken heart.
Not too shabs, Pam.
Are you kidding? 36 guys? It's like Schindler's List up in here.
- Pam! - And I'm like that little Gandhi dude.
- Pam.
- Helping out with the books, and Inappropriate analogies? What the hell is wrong with you? Nothing.
I'm a desirable full-bodied woman but nobody will have sex with me.
And I have so much love to give.
- Get on the desk.
- Really? Yeah, come on.
Before I change my mind.
- But you cannot say a word.
- I won't tell anybody.
No, honey, I mean during.
Cause I'm gonna pretend you're Alex Karras.
And that's your message? My God, who? Who's there? What do you want? Because all you're gonna get is holes.
L I mean holes in you not my Hah! - Sterling? - Hello, Mother.
Where the hell have you been? - I don't know.
- And why do you have a cleaver? - I don't know.
- Well, you're safe now.
So get out.
- I'm hungry.
- So lick that coat.
You smell like a - Grilled cheese.
- What? - Grill me a cheese.
- I'm not grilling you a cheese.
Oh, for God's sake.
Waltz in here, dressed like some sort of cattle-rapist.
Waving a cleaver and reeking of what I hope to God is meat.
And that's all you have to say? - I don't know.
- I was worried sick.
Called you twice came this close to leaving And why doesn't your voicemail just say, "Leave a message, I'm a jackass"? - I don't know.
- I don't know.
I don't know.
What is wrong with you? My head hurts.
And I have no father.
Sterling, of course you have a father.
- Just maybe not the one you wanted.
- And you And me neither.
Because even though that whole weekend is just a big jazzy blur, I'm pretty sure it wasn't Buddy.
- And all these years, you lied to me.
- Sterling, I was protecting you.
From what, this sandwich? - This is Swiss, Mother! - Because that's all I had.
You ass.
- Just like I'm all that you have.
- Well, I hate it.
And I hate you.
Sterling Malory Archer, you will eat every last crumb of that sandwich.
- No.
- Then get out.
I'll call you a cab.
Sterling, stop that this instant.
- Kill Mother.
- Waah! Ah.
Kill Mother.
Police, police, have to call the Waah! Déja vu, huh? I'm having a nightmare and you lock me out of your bedroom? - Sterling, no, stay back.
- Only this time, you'll be crying for help.
- Sterling! - And I'll be the one drinking and laughing in there with Uncle Buddy! - Sterling, I'm warning you.
Sterling! Sterling? Sterling.
Sterling! What? God.
Well, whose fault is that? Waving a cleaver, screaming in Russian? - I'm sorry.
- Ass.
Seriously, I don't know what's going on with my head.
Filthy coat, can't tell what's cow's blood and what's yours.
The wet blood, Mother, is mine.
- And it's ruining my brand-new linens.
- Sorry.
- This is why I can't have nice things.
- Why, because you shoot them? Serves you right.
You nearly scared me to death.
Well, you obviously weren't that scared, judging by your grouping.
- Uhn.
- Hah.
Guess the old gal's still got it.
- All six, right in the ten ring.
- Hooray.
Just like I taught you.
Without any help from whoever your father is.
- Yeah, you were always there for me.
- Which I never really thank you for.
- Sterling, I don't need thanks.
That's what makes me such a wonderful mother.
- Ha-ha.
Are you kidding? - Don't be shitty.
- Can't we just enjoy the moment? - Yeah, how could we not? Ass.
So if you want paper towels in there, you'll just have to supply your own.
Where do you get paper towels? And, last item, on a related note, I have no choice but to cut salaries.
Eight percent, across the board! And let's just put a lid on it! Do we have to supply our own lids? Look, I didn't invent the economy! And until Isis gets in the black, we all have to make some sacrifices, so Line one for you.
It's your furrier.
Unbelievable! We have to cut back but you're buying new horseshoes? Tell him to send over the gray fox.
See? Sacrifice.
At this rate I'll be reduced to wearing nutria.
On your horse with his fancy new shoes.
Oh for the That's a farrier! I know.
And this Is Konrad Schlotz.
Herr Schlotz controls all of Europe's Videotex services.
Videotex? Wow, growth industry So he's worth billions.
And I want to convince him to invest in Isis.
Well that's gonna be a tough sell We've posted losses for fifteen straight quarters, so So that's why you're going to cook up a different set of books, Cyril.
Ooh no, I'm not comfortable with that.
Think you'd be more comfortable on another little vacation? Upstairs? No, I was dating Lana but since I suffer from sexual addiction, which these quacks deny is even real, now they're treating me for Can somebody! Please! Shut up that damn coyote? Clormatrazapam? No.
No I would not.
So unless you want me send you back I will start cooking the books.
Good thing you know how to cheat.
Hey, ya know what? Enough! Now then, this is a two-prong operation.
The books are prong one, while prong two is El Frente Rojo.
Derby day, wore that exact same hat.
Shock! Herr Schlotz fears they may attempt a kidnapping during a birthday party he's throwing this weekend in Gstaad Ach, Gstaad! - Oh yeah, count me in! - And me out.
I'm not getting frostbite protecting some old German guy.
Herr Schlotz isn't the intended victim.
It's his daughter, Anka Who obviously needs someone on her constantly, and so I will be that someone, who is constantly on her! For God's sake, Sterling, she's turning seventeen! Oh, eww! Sorry, even for you Archer C'mon, she doesn't look like she's just turning seventeen! No, she looks like she's just turning eighteen.
Exactly.
Plus Europeans use the metric system, which Sterling Malory Archer, you will not touch a single hair on that girl.
I See? How I just let that go by? Look at me.
I'm the perfect gentleman.
No.
This is completely unacceptable.
Cutbacks, I get it, but you cannot expect me to share a room with Ray.
Aw, I'll be gentle Mother! You know what he's implying, right? Stop whining, we're all making do.
Why, I'm sharing a room with Lana Hooray And Pam's sleeping in the cellar.
Yeah, and if money's so damn tight, why is she even here? Eh, she's making me mule back a buncha this crap That "crap" is three hundred dollars a bottle, and you can't get it in America, so not another sip! And the rest of you, make room in your luggage for ten liters apiece.
Unbelievable I know, what kind of limit is that? Ah gut, you are here, Frau Archer! Ah ah ah! It's Fraulein Archer! She added, desperately And these are my top agents, who are ready to lay down their lives to protect your, um Lovely daughter.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that Ja, but if it does Let's hope not.
You must protect my princess.
Anka is all I have in the world since her mother passed away.
Oh, you poor thing.
- You're a widower? - Oh, like you didn't KNOW! No! No! - What is wrong with you? - Did no one just see that? Jumpy, eh? Truly, *** has not frightened the famous Sterling Archer.
No, she does! - My Anka? What do you mean? - Oh, right! Yeah, Archer, Anka is dirty sexy.
- What? - Sterling! She is only 16! - I - Oh, schwein! No, I know! I'm not.
- Don't come near her again.
- Come on! And the rest of you, get to work.
Come, Anka! Oh, hell, I hope you're happy.
No, I'm not, mother.
I just got fingered.
You know, that is just ewwh.
Just thanks a lot, Bitch and Sundance.
- What? - What? What what? Didn't you see that? I saw you totally, eye-banged a teenager.
No you didn't, because I wasn't! - Whatever.
- Go, wash up, dirty bird.
- I wasn't eye-banging her.
- Man, I was.
What? Geez, I'm only human! Are you? Ay, that stinks.
So don't smell it, don't smell it.
Another perfect example of your reductive reasoning! Basta, queridos! Que es esto? He started it.
Can't I leave you two alone for even one hour without you going at it? I should have asked myself the same thing about you two Meaning what? Meaning you left me for my brother! Your twin brother.
So obviously I still find you very attractive.
And I have good news! Even though Sterling Archer is here in Gstaad Archer?! Ay, dios mio! It won't be a problem to kidnap that bourgeois perrita.
Her father has forbidden Archer to go near her! So then we go with my plan.
Your plan stinks more than that cheese.
I think that smell is them.
But even they smell better than your stupid plan.
We go with my plan.
Fine.
You don't want the world's greatest secret agent on the case? Fine! You want little countess Von Fingerbang to get kidnapped? Fine! Oh oh oh, and as for you, Ray! Sterling Archer may be many things, but he's not Fine? Oh, I think he is very fine Hey no no, Anka, you can't be in here! Anka? Mr.
Archer, how familiar you are.
You must address me by title Countess Von Fingerbang.
Noooope! C'mon Anka, seriously, you seriously gotta get outta here before Shit! Before the cops show up, or Wait, what do you have in Switzerland, some kinda pikemen? I don't know I am from Germany.
Where the age of consent is fourteen.
What is it, the Alabama of Europe? In many ways yes, but We can talk about that in bed.
No we can't! Seriously you have to Hand over the girl, cochino! And that is just it for today, on people calling me a frickin pig! Holy shit, did you see that? I saw you save my life! No, I Well maybe a little, and I know just how to repay you! Wait no no no! Bad touch, bad touch! You schwein! So, does this look as bad as it looks? I will let the gendarmes decide that! Oh, so they're not pikemen Wait! Anka, tell your father what happened.
Papa, he lured me.
And then he tried to touch me with his Wilhelm! No, I saved her life! Look, I set a kidnapper on fire! Tell it to the gendarmes! Schwein! Oh c'mon, did you not just see that? Sterling, you promised! And yet here you stand, as a fortune walks away, with your wedding tackle stuffed into your shaving kit! "Schwein.
" Doesn't even touch it.
Yeah? Well neither did I, mother! I saved her life! Go ask that dick I set on fire! And speaking of, that bay rum really burns on the owww! Hello, razor! Welcome to the party! you, Switzerland.
You're damn lucky Anka convinced her father not to press charges.
Yeah, I feel lucky.
Let's see, sexually assaulted by a teenage sociopath, interrogated by gendarmes.
- Oh, three stitches on my penis.
- Uh.
So yeah, it's all breaking my way! Well just stay of my way.
I have to convince Schlotz to get in bed with Isis.
And failing that, in bed with Don't! Say it.
I'm in enough pain.
Yeah, the entire hotel's talking about your little shaving accident.
Hooray And if you wanna get Schlotz into you Phrasing! You better start eating strudel.
Maaajor chubby chaser Well, a lot of that's muscle Let's hope not Cause ya get pretty strong arms growing up on a dairy farm.
A dairy farm? Yes, it was called Butterfat Ranch No it And they had a big cheese-rodeo.
It was poovey farms.
I also was raised on a dairy farm! Yer shitting me! What was yer breed? Friesianu! We had Holsteins! Jeez, they're like Cousins! Wow! Man, all this cow-talk is making me thirsty for some milk.
And as luck has it, there is some chilling in my suite.
Well let's get some! Don't wait up That is so classic her.
Chasing a billionaire while we could all be surrounded by terrorists, because we don't even know what they look like! Well, spoiler alert: One of them doesn't have any skin on his face.
Meaning what? Meaning I set one of them on fire? Was that before or after you got caught fondling a teenager? Well, obviously before! After was all Gendarmes and dick-stitches! Ugh And I didn't touch her, Lana, so there's no reason to be jealous! Whatever! How's your Wilhelm? Aagh! Should I kiss it and make it better? No, you should get away from me! Look, I'm serious, you need help! You need help, Archer! She came up to me! Ray, what is a What did you call it? "Blow job?" What? Shame on you! Fie and shame! And it's something a grown-up does when he loves another grown-up.
Now raus, you mouse, get ready for our ski lesson.
She's giving you a ski lesson? No, I'm giving her one.
Oh yeah right, I forgot you won the Olympic gold medal in men's downhill.
Well, ass, it was giant slalom And I only took bronze.
So you lost.
Well, I came in third.
Yeah, which is last.
Which is third.
In the world.
You lost, Ray.
Jesus, get over it.
It actually was a huge disappointment.
*** Months of preparation ruined! How could you be so stupid? Carlito, he obviously did not mean to get set on fire.
We should have gone with my plan.
Which was superior in every way! So then now we do your plan.
My plan requires three people.
Three people who have faces! Putamadre! Now I must call headquarters for reinforcements.
Good idea, mi amor.
You are so clever.
And sexy.
That sounds like Schlotz, but Oh my God, Pam must be getting naked! All these idiots think about sex.
It's called nymphomania.
Maybe mixed with borderline personality disorder, I mean I dunno, Lana, I'm not a developmental psychologist, but Archer, I'm serious I'm serious.
That girl's a nightmare.
No, a nightmare is sharing a room with your mother, who expects me to Loofah, I know Protect! Some eurotrash brat! Who's got about a jillion guests coming to her stupid birthday party tomorrow! Yeah Think they're gonna have a band? Or just a DJ? I don't Why don't you go find out? No, I can't be alone.
That's when she strikes, like a slutty little ninja.
Eww, is that Schlotz and Pam? And are they drinking anti-freeze? Let's hope.
Ugh, change it, before I puke my Holy shit! Lana, look! That's the kidnapper I set on fire! That guy? Who's never been on fire? He was, though! Lana, I swear You swear? Like you swore about a ninety-pound schoolgirl raping ya? Attempted rape, Lana, and that guy was running around like Johnny Storm.
AKA the human torch, Lana, duh! And if you don't believe me, fine Hey! I can take care of myself.
Ow! Oh, great, yeah, go terrorize the bell hop.
Good thing the gun was empty.
Oh, shit.
God, I hate it when he's right.
Now he gets to be the big hero who has no bullets.
Going against an unknown number of radical terrorists armed with automatic weapons.
So that's gonna Ugh, dammit.
Herr Schlotz, herr Schlotz! Are you in there? I need to ask you a tiny My God, woman, can't you not read? Not without my glasses, so I was hoping if you could read this to me Perhaps in your suite over a drink Yeah, come on in Just making a fresh batch of green Russians.
Ow ow ow ow ow ow.
First thing when I get back, buying an electric razor.
That's no fun Oh for [beep]'s sake! Then you don't get to squirt that hot white cream all over your face.
Why aren't you with Gillette? As the ski lift was coming, at the last moment I jumped out of the way! Dukes, I am gonna be in huge trouble Right after I freeze to death.
Double dukes! Oh great, they cut the power! How romantic Yeah it is.
No, not romantic, dangerous! Because it's gonna be dark soon.
So before it is too dark, let me ask your opinion on something What're you No no, re-zip, re-zip! Do you think I need a boob job? Honestly? Wh-? I'm kidding! Anka, c'mon, you're gonna be a beautiful woman someday.
Really? Yes, really.
And literally, the minute you turn eighteen please call me, but Save your minutes! Because tonight Sterling Archer dies! Oh yeah? Oh no.
Don't shoot the girl, we need her! Archer, you must save me! Got any ideas? Because I'm all ears! Why don't we take that? Well obviously we're gonna take that.
C'mon! Oh, Archer! We are safe now, ja? Well, it's a little early to say But I really kinda doubt it.
I mean, I'm sure I've been in worse situations But right now I'm kinda drawing a blank.
What the hell's all that, ya reckon? Immigrants.
Cramming their lowriders full of free health care and Snow.
We should go to the gendarmerie! Yeah, if you weren't topless! Oh, and hadn't accused me of molesting you! Are you going to throw that in my face for the rest of my life? Yeah, all four minutes of it! Idiota! The girl is worth millions! Be careful where you are shooting! Ooh, Pink Floyd show! Oh.
Man, I'm gonna be in trouble Trouble dukes.
Where are we going? The forest! They'll have to split up in there, then we can take 'em out one or two at a time! You want to fight them? Are you insane? No, just incredibly pissed off! You can't believe what this is doing to my stitches! Okay, I need you to do exactly what I tell you when I tell you, without We should just go to the what? Because I came in second, smartass! Out of how many? Two? Will ya just shut up and drive? How do I do it? Right hand! Take the throttle! Like this? No, ya gotta twist it! I am twisting it! No, you gotta Hang on a second! You gotta twist it like this.
You've gotta go faster, Anka! Faster? I'm freezing to death already! You shoulda thought of that before you took your stupid clothes off! Seriously, would you go? I'm doing it like you said.
Grip it as hard as you can, and twist the absolute shit out of it! Oh, I get it! Just like men love it on their Wilhelm! No we don't Oh, my God! You've never even seen a Wilhelm! Wh-? I have seen dozens! Scores even! You are such a liar! I bet you've never even gotten to second base! I Well, so maybe not! So what? What do you mean so what? Why do you behave like No one cares how I behave! Mama is gone, papa is always at work, so I just rot away at that boarding school! Yeah, and then I bet you get Sent off to camp all summer! Riding camp, skiing camp! Lacrosse camp! It's like he doesn't want me around! Yeah, so you misbehave because You just want a little attention! And it's so hard to make friends! Because you're insecure, so you overcompensate, and come across as A snob, or arrogant, yeah, no I get it! You know Archer, I think you and I are a lot alike I don't do that! Okay, I think that's all of em! Which is good, because I'm out of ammo And we're out of gas.
Fantastic.
Guess we'll have to hike back.
Oh my God! You must be freezing.
Hey relax, you're gonna be okay.
We'll get you back to the hotel and All the wind from the driving, Archer, my hands are really burning! Ooh, that's first-degree frostbite.
Too bad you don't have big, mitteny gloves, like me.
I can't feel a thing in these.
And it's like my breasts are on fire! I, um, just maybe put your hands on them.
My hands are like ice! But yours are No! - Please - No, we can make it back in like - half hour tops.
- I can't wait that long.
Please, with such big, mitteny gloves, it won't even count! Nooope! But I could get nerve damage! That's actually a possibility.
Please, Archer! Just for one minute! Um Literally one minute, and only because this is a medical emergency.
Ahh that feels nice.
No it doesn't, don't enjoy this, this is a medical proced Oww! What's wrong? Nothing, just um My stitches.
Oh yeah? Gettin' a little "local swelling?" Right.
I can't believe I let this happen It was those damn green Russians.
Yeah, they pack a wallop And if you ever breathe a word of this, I will gut you like a carp.
Hey, what happens in Gstaad Stays in Gstaad.
Now who's ready for a shower? This gal!
Splendid.
Yes.
And we'll work out all the details when hm? Yes, it sounds amazing, it really does, but We'll talk about it when you get here.
Hm? Mm.
Something on your mind, dear? Not anymore.
What in the a microchip? Russian markings? What on earth is this? Krieger thinks it's some kind of satellite-linked mind-control device.
Mind control? Why does he think that? - Because he removed it from my brain? - What?! I told Krieger about my headaches, he gives me a cat-scan, then boom.
Next thing I know he shoots me full of some kinda, I dunno, fish paralyzer - That crazy - And then it was drill, baby, drill.
Oh my God, how do you feel? Little pissed off, actually.
- Well that's understan - Because it was obviously put in my brain in the first place by your boyfriend, Nikolai Jakov of the KGB! Sterling, first of all we're not even together anymore - I bet.
- And second of all! Why would he put a mind-control chip into your brain? I assume because he thinks he's my father! And what, you think he wanted to mind-control you into loving him? You tell me! That's your specialty! - Get out.
- No.
Yes! Mother, you've been lying to me my entire life! Just for once, I want you to tell me the truth! Well, people in hell want ice water.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm right in the middle of a fairly huge deal.
Buying a lock factory? For your information, I'm no, never mind, you'll find out soon enough as it is.
Oh, that's classic you! Avoid the truth, bury the secrets, hide the - Oh for theI'm selling ISIS! - You what?! There! Happy? No.
Mother, tell me this is a joke! The only joke is my bank statement.
What? Everything I had was in a hedge fund, but it turns out the whole thing was nothing but a damn Ponzi scheme I lost all my money.
I'm ruined.
so you're selling ISIS? She what?! Aww, maaan That's totally not iree.
Then why don't you go back to Jamaica? A, because I got deported, and B So can she actually sell ISIS? Like, doesn't the government own it? Yeah, I've never been clear on that.
It's way too complicated to explain, especially to you two, but short answer yes, she can sell ISIS.
The question is, who would buy it? ODIN?! CHERYL/CAROL Or whom Yes, ODIN.
Why would ODIN want to buy Oh my God, is Len Trexler behind this?! He made me a very attractive offer.
I bet! That's because he wants to you know, that! With you! - But wait a minute, does he know you're - Gorgeous! Hello, Leonard! Hello, beautiful! Hey, kiddo.
Hey back and if you don't mind, we're kind of in the middle of something?! Actually Sterling, if you don't mind? Len and I have a lot to talk about.
Like selling ISIS out from under us?! That, and the round-the-world luxury cruise I'm taking with your mom.
- The what? - Hopefully in the honeymoon suite! The what?! And then the unemployment office, after ODIN lays us all off.
Ugh! That totally stinks! Eh, you were on borrowed time anyway.
No, that! What are you eating?! Ackee and saltfish.
Yeah thanks, this is only mohair! So, you really think ODIN's gonna get rid of everybody? No.
Not everybody In fact, ODIN plans to promote a very select few ISIS personnel to fill some of the impending vacancies.
Vacancies like? Malory Archer's chair.
Wh-? Really?! Well figuratively, I mean I don't know about the actual chair, but - So I'd be like, like the - Regional director for the Americas.
Barry, that's my dream job! Yours for the taking.
If you are similarly mine.
For the taking.
Taking as in to get this job I'd have to have sex with you? Your words.
And also mine.
Yes.
Hey! hey! Do you idiots wanna hear my plan or not?! Okay, so suggestions.
About what? What're we talking about?! Stopping my mother from selling ISIS to ODIN! You said you had a plan! My plan, is to crowdsource a plan! My ear bells! Don't you people have work to do?! Not for long, huh? Uh, can't wait to welcome each and every one of you into the ODIN family! And speaking of, kiddo, hope you're gonna welcome me into your family.
My fam, uh, uh, uhrrowrrmf! Ugh! You people better not track that onto the carpet! It's filthy enough as it is.
C'mon, Len.
I'll follow you anywhere, my sweet! - Holy shitsnacks - Is Trexler buying ISIS just to get your mother to marry him?! - No! Yes! Look, shut up.
- That is some high-priced MILF.
Hey! Shut up! And think of a way to make Trexler not want my mother! We could give her a MILFectomy.
If you say milf one more time, I will shoot you in your eyeballs.
She does have a point, though Not the m-i-l-f part! - But if we could make Trexler fall out of love - How? Trust me, you can't control a person's heart.
You can with a little thing I like to call a deep-cycle marine battery.
Or LSD.
Is that what you've been giving me?! Yes? - Well that explains a lot - I thought those were breath strips! But anyway, whatever, emotions like "love" don't actually come from the heart, they The brain! Yeah.
Or LSD.
Oh, come on Where is the trust? What could be so secret she wired it up with twelve pounds of C-4? Ugh, I don't think I even wanna know What.
Nice.
Here, take a look at this.
Okay, which one of these wires Blue and yellow.
Ya wanna look at it for more than half a second? I wired the damn thing! Ass! Well I didn't know that! Ass! - Okay - I lied, I didn't wire it.
ARCHER What?! Badumpbump.
You think that's funny? Not compared to that.
What is that? Oh yeah.
No no no no no, Ray what do I do?! - Well if you don't shut if off - She'll know somebody was in here! So you could wait for the batteries to die - Okay, yeah that's - But sounds like there's about four big ol' D-cells in it.
- ARCHER Aww, maaan - Yeah, it's it's pretty big.
Is it black? - ARCHER Wh-? No, it's - Slightly darker black? ARCHER No! It's not any kind of black! - Racist.
- Shut up! It's more of a Aubergine? I guess you'd call that? Oh.
Still pretty hot.
Will you shut up? - Take a picture.
- Shut up! Okay, I'm going in.
Aww man, can't believe I'm doing this Try to think about something else.
Like how there's no sink in there.
So what if there's no Oh my God! Yeah.
There's no sink! Ugh there's not enough liquor and therapy in the world to undo that.
I touched my mother's dildo.
You shoulda borrowed these.
They're like super heavy du aagh! Hey! What the hell're you doing? What're you doing?! Making robot birds? Lana we're in crisis mode, Mother's trying to sell us to ODIN! I know.
So how about don't break any more stuff in my new office? Your new oh my God, ODIN's making you the new boss? Yup.
I mean, I kinda maybe have to sleep with Barry, but ARCHER Wh-?! Lana, how can you do that?! By getting drunk and knowing it's the same thing your mother's doing? And I know that it's killing you that she's leaving you for another man, and you better not mess it up for me.
Speaking of mess, you traitor, your stupid birdbot is leaking.
My what? Aw, shit! Probably hydraulic fluid.
It's sweet-and-sour, dumbass! Yeah who's the dumbass now, Lana? - Or whom - Barry.
How's your shattered femur? How's your creepily childlike feeling of maternal abandonment? The sale isn't final yet, Barry.
No, but it will be.
And we're here to make sure of it.
So don't try to do anything stupid.
I don't have to try.
Shit, whatever, move.
Barry, is that how you get ants? Yes it is, Other Barry, yes it is.
Okay, the satellite link is online So let's play God.
Freaky I'll tell what's freaky, is guess what I had already named this bunny.
Rabbert Klein.
Wow, that's actually better.
All yours.
So can you put it in a person's brain? He'd suffocate.
Not the rabbit, idiot! The chip! Oh! Yes, absolutely! Without killing the person? Oh.
Yeah, maybe.
Ahhhh doesn't that feel good? Feels better than this offer.
Len, I need at least twenty percent down.
Aww c'mon, it's not like you need the money.
You're already loaded.
What if I weren't? Then you'd know I loved you for you.
You really do, don't you? And always have.
What about all those years you spent shacked up with what's-her-face, the crazy one? - Anastasia - No, the tall brunette.
Crazy-crazy.
Yeah, Anastasia.
She killed herself.
Oh.
Right, sorry.
Yeah, that's how you like it, huh? - All down in your nooks and crannies - So hey, hate to interrupt - your conversation - It wasn't a conversation Lana, I was just talking to my gun, not with it.
Pretty big difference.
Huge, yeah, so, are they in there signing the sale contract, or? - As we speak.
- Yessss! Cause I've got tons of ideas to run this place more efficiently once I'm ODIN's regional director.
Already jotted a bunch down.
Hey, that's great.
Hope you bring that same kind of enthusiasm and self-starterishness to having sex with me.
Oh.
- So us hooking up is still, um - A perquisite for the job, yeah.
Or is do I mean prerequisite? Either way, Barry's pretty stoked.
Okay, so that's Barry and Lana Pam, you're the amorphous - rasta-blob - Big ups.
Those are the ODIN guys, Ray you're the little pink sailor, and Why do you have so many damn dolls in here? For sexual harrassment complaints.
So people can non-verbally indicate where stuff happened on their body.
Yeah that takes like, one doll.
Not if there's ever a gang rape.
Cyril, better pill up.
You're assisting Krieger with the surgery.
- Wh-? ! Why me?! - You're good at math.
How is that supposed to help?! Can't hurt.
Ray you lure Lana into the mainframe, Carol you lure Barry I wanna lure Barry! Wrong bait Ray, he's straight.
How do you know? How do I he was engaged! I was married! For two years.
I mean, she was a lesbian, but still we met in a "Pray Away the Gay" bible group.
That was a pretty weird time for me.
Just get Lana in the mainframe! I'll take care of Trexler, and Pam? You're job is to neutralize the ODIN agents.
How the shit am I s'posed to do that?! With Krieger's magic breath strips.
But do not touch them.
Lysergic acid is absorbed right through the skin.
Even the tip of your fing uh-oh.
Oh for [BEEP]'s sake, Krieger! You're about to do brain surgery! Yeah, so sooner's gonna be better than later.
Dammit, how much time do we have?! For me, usually about twenty minutes.
- Usually?! - Less if I take two.
Man, you have got a problem.
Oh right, like you're one to talk.
Yeah, Pillbo Baggins.
- CYRIL These are from a doctor! - So?! Krieger's a doctor! Not a medical doctor! Not even the other kind.
Technically.
I gotta tell ya guys Um, not feeling super-confident bout this plan.
Racist.
I guess you must be the infamous "Barry" everyone's talking about.
Yeah, go away? - Infamously few of words I guess! - Go away.
Um, so Lana said to give you this? Pretty succinct.
Guess you guys have lots in common! Like, I bet your genitals are the same distance from the ground.
Look alive, gang.
I think Archer's gonna try to torpedo this deal, so until the contract is signed, don't let Archer anywhere near that office.
What're you don't do that, You asshole.
We're buying this place.
- Carpet's shitty enough as it is - I'll tell ya what's shitty, is somebody's breath around here.
Whoa! Here, take three or four of 'em.
Probably won't kill you guys, either.
Cause somebody smells like they ate the ass end out of a northbound cow.
Well? What do you think? I think I'm gonna miss you so much! Aww honey, you're not going anywhere.
Not when I'm the regional director.
But are you sure you'll get the job? Totally, yes! I mean, I do kinda have to sleep with Barry, Oh right, he said tell you he's in the mainframe and it's now or never.
- Really? - Used those exact words.
Uck.
It all feels so dirty.
Yeah, the carpet in there's gross.
No, trading sex for this job.
- I mean it's the chance of a lifetime, but - Honey, look at me.
We all gotta do what we all gotta do.
You wouldn't hate me for it? Oh, God no.
But just do reverse cowgirl, because that carpet's seriously heinous.
Wow! So guess that worked, huh? Pamela cool runnins, mon.
ARCHER God, would you give it a rest, um uh Damn, I had something for this.
Blob Marley.
Alright, there's my signature.
- And once you countersign - We can set sail for romance! Mazatlan, Maui, maybe even a small wedding on the beach in Tahiti? Yeah, about that Can I borrow Len for a second? Why? To give him my blessing in asking for your hand in marriage? Well that's just weird.
No, it's beautiful! Well maybe not traditional, but it's a damn classy move! After you, kiddo! - Barry? - In here! Just doing some deep knee bends.
Nude.
Wanted to stay loose.
Yeah, so listen, about the job, and this I don't think I can do it.
Then why'd you send me that note? What note? What the ?! Hey! Hey! Open this damn door! Sorry, honey! Please don't hate me! Just doing what I gotta do I sorta pictured more of a lounge, Morris chairs, that kinda stuff - ARCHER Yeah.
So listen, about you and Mother - We're in love, kiddo.
Well, maybe you're in love.
She's just in need.
- Of what? - Of money! She's broke, Trexler, she lost everything in a Ponzi scheme.
- So what're you saying, she's - Using you! You dumb idiot! Doesn't matter.
I'm crazy about her! And if I can be there for her when she really needs me, then all the better! I was afraid you'd say that.
Why? Ow! Why are you doing that?! - Hello - What is that?! Fish paralyzer? Okay.
Okay, he's out.
How's Krieger doing? Not, um, great.
Yes he is, let's do this! - So, are we gonna do this or? - No, we're not.
For a big list of reasons, at the top of which is Archer.
You're not still into that guy? No! But he's out there, somewhere and somehow, dashing all my hopes.
Look this sale is gonna happen.
So what we should do is spread our clothes around, so our naked bodies don't touch this carpet.
Oh, for the sweet-and-sour? Might as well start an ant farm.
And what's taking those two so long? Wow.
So that didn't take long, huh? - I dunno - That was rhetorical.
Okay, Krieger! - Yes! - What are you doing? - What's next?! - Uh uh uhOkay, cue visual! Roger! Cueing visual! Awww! There's my lovely lady love! - Okay now, uh wow, that feels good - Krieger! Oh! Commence the Modified Ludovico! Commencing the Modified Ludovico! Aaghh! No no no, I don't like this! Who is that horrible woman?! That's Malory Archer.
You love her.
Oh no.
Oh no no no no.
Ick! - Krieger?! - Uh, uhcommence satellite link! Commencing satellite link! So, you wouldn't want to marry her? No, eww! No, please! Make it stop! - Uh, uh, what do I do, what do I - Just hit tab! Oh.
- Idiot.
- Okay, it's over.
And you're sure you don't want to marry that woman.
Oh God, no! No, ya know what I want? - Tell me.
- Some of that lettuce.
- Um okay.
- Or actually all of it? And the bunny attached to it, he's attached right, can I have the bunny and the lettuce? Uh, can we give Lenny the rabbit? And the lettuce! Sure thing.
Go to town.
Yeah cause they're brothers.
Is he always going to be like this, cause now I feel bad.
Sterling? Len? Either and or both? Where the hell are you? ! Len!! Yeah, do you know where he is? Yes, I'm just screaming his name down the hall to celebrate that fact.
- That some kinda joke? - Is that? It's cold in here.
Because she's here! The big bad lady is here and she is cooold! Len, what's going on?! You're mean and I don't like you and I don't want ISIS or you and all I want is this lettuce and his brother - Rabbert Klein - Rabbert Klein, so Barry, you ass, for the love of all that's green take me and Rabbert to the lettuce store! - Sterling Malory Archer - Yes, Mother I'm here for you.
You did the right thing, honey.
LANA And all it cost me was my dream job.
And a broken hand.
- Which kills - Here.
- I'm good.
- Racist.
Buy you a cup of coffee? Ya know, since you're broke? You meddling ass.
- Sterling, I know what you did to Trexler.
- I didn't do anyth Yes you did! Because certain "items" in my desk Bop bop bop bop bop! I can't hear you.
- were not where I put them! - Bop bop bop bop bop! And we never need to speak of that sickening invasion of privacy again.
Yeah, and the neverer the better.
But since I can only assume that Russian mind-control chip is rattling - around in Len Trexler's bald head - Not rattling, - Krieger stapled it - I had to go Plan B, and lease out three floors in the building And also sell the cleaners.
You sold the cleaners? To who? - Or whom - Wh-? ! Popeye?! Mmm-hm.
And he paid upfront, in cash! Yeah not surprising, considering the fact he's a loan-sharking pimp! Former loan-sharking pimp.
I'm going legitimate.
What do you know about dry cleaning?! I know you still owe me three grand.
- Yeah and I told you - And I also know I got five of your hand-tailored suits in the back.
Wh-? You're holding my suits hostage?! Collateral.
Now get the outta my cleaners.
I think it's a good fit.
See you tomorrow Popeye! Mm-hm.
What do I know about dry cleaning I know I'm switching from perc to D5.
Goin green up in here.
What do you even do here? Sit on your ass and analyze data? I'm a field agent, Isaac Newton, I risk my life, so yeah I do deserve the best space in the parking garage.
Like it would kill you to roll 50 feet.
Stupid thing's electric.
Archer, I still haven't got those TNE reports you promised.
Are you sure? You didn't eat them? Yeah, well, since Lana broke up with me I've been finding solace in food.
Well, keep your chins up Cyril.
All eleven of them.
Cyril's about half a rack, huh? Yeah, so why do you pick on him? I, oh, was that a rhetorical? And why are you bleaching everything? Ugh because it sneezed out here! Okay.
And is mother in? - Oh, she's in there, all right, - And they're expecting you.
Thanks, crazy.
Who's they? Hello, Archer.
Trinette?! Why are you here? You don't call me for a year, and that's how you talk to me?! Yes, dear.
Where are your manners? Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I skipped the Emily post chapter about how to introduce your mother to a hooker! Escort! Ya puke.
And I'm retired.
Yeah? Your 401k doing that well? I have a sep, smartass! Oh, and this.
So I ain't worried about gettin' by.
What is Why, is this a subpoena? It's for the paternity test.
The what?! Yes, "the what," dear And "the who.
" What who?! Who is that?! Why, this is Seamus McGoon Sterling.
No, Seamus Sterling McGoon Archer.
And why is that "who" named like me?! Why do ya think? I'm asking you why! Because he's your son.
You colossal idiot.
Why? Why didn't you just get the vasectomy like I ask you to? - Honestly, I thought it would hurt.
- And this doesn't? - It-it's apples and oranges.
- I'm not ready to be a grandmother.
- Really? But you're so Grandmother-ly? No Old.
If and when I am ready for a grandchild it won't be the potato face spawn - of some Irish whore! - Exactly.
It's probably not! I mean, seriously, what're the odds on that? - So she had a lot of Ugh - You kidding? I used to have to book her weeks in advance.
- Although - Although what? Um whew! Wow, Trinette, that was amazing.
Yeah, that Wh-?! Wait a minute! You liar! This ain't a condom wrapper, it's from a frickin' candy bar! So? Sometimes I like to treat myself.
Well, sometimes I like to ovulate! Well, I gotta sleep, so do it somewhere else.
Money's on the dresser.
Nothing.
Hundred-to-one, he's mine.
Well, he better not be! My God, I couldn't bear the shame it would bring on this - family to have um - No.
Please, mother, finish that thought! Oh my God, you're such a hypocrite! You were gonna say "illegitimate child"! No, I was going to say "bastard.
" Ouch.
I mean, that's gotta hurt, huh? Why should I care if Archer knocked up some dumb hooker? Because babies are soft-skulled, fat little germsacks, and now we've all been exposed to that one's bacteria! What? Don't engage her.
But c'mon, Lana, you dated Mr.
Archer forever and And you have nothing to show for it.
Paging doctor Loggins.
Couple things One, I don't need a baby to validate my existence.
Two, the absolute last person on earth I'd have a baby with is Archer, because he is not sold separately.
Did you try Yeah, I'll come over, mother.
Just gimme 20 minutes.
Well, I'm sorry, Lana! But I didn't invent the childproof pill bottle! So as far as Archer's concerned, I actually feel like I dodged the world's most dysfunctional bullet.
Yeah, but Cyril was Oh, wait! Did he have some sort of character flaw? Hello, hello, hello! Couple things - Yeah, we are code blue here - Hey, yeah, blue! Like for baby boys! - No, I meant like for her face, but - No, like for let's have a baby shower for Trinette and the wee baby Seamus! Oh, my God, yes.
But you're place is disgusting, so where can we have it? Well, Archer's got that bangin' pad.
Ooh, he'll hate that! I wanna come! Ooh, I think I just did And, so, thank you both for coming.
Even though, Mr.
Archer is the only party named in the subpoena.
Well, we both have invested interest in the outcome of this silly test.
And said test will, obviously, be administered by a third party, so A third party?! But we have a state-of-the-art laboratory at ISIS! Normally, I wouldn't let an intern do this on his first day but Chet? How's it hanging, buddy? I'm sure you do.
But our client has concerns about the integrity of the test results, given your agency's clandestine nature.
Oh, and by the way, super-crazy about that elevator pretending it's a dryer.
Barry? But all kidding aside, ODIN will be providing security for the paternity test.
- Odin?! - Oh, yeah.
Hello, Archer.
Barry.
- How's it hanging, buddy? - Hanging great, Barry.
How's the leg? Barry, does it hurt? Cause it looks like it kinda hurts.
It did hurt, and it still does, so So how can Trinette afford ODIN?! This is pro Bono.
Consider it payback for my shattered femur.
And that reminds me doctor Ben? Wh-?! And what the hell is this?! We take a blood sample from Archer My God? What year is this?! I know, right?! Why can't you just take a DNA swab?! A blood sample is enough to determine paternity.
And after we take a liter A liter?! How much is a Owww! Archer will be left in a weakened state, which should prevent his attempting to compromise the test.
Turtlenecks, I invented those.
You're bleeding him dry! Ser'sly, Barry, how much is a liter? About 8 gills.
What's a gill? You're just talkin' in circles.
Thanks doctor Ben.
Next! Under ODIN guard, the sample is taken to the vault of First Savings Bank.
I don't know why I told you where, but it doesn't matter, as the bank and vault will be surrounded by ODIN agents.
Merely an added precaution, as the vault is basically one big shitstorm of anti-intrusion devices.
Tomorrow, in full view of both parties, we will test the sample here, along with a blood sample from wee baby Seamus, thus ensuring complete accuracy of the paternity test.
Any questions? Yeah, Barry I'm still unclear on the liter thing? Vis-a-vis, uh, unit of volume I seriously don't feel good at all.
That's because those ODIN ghouls drained a fifth of your blood.
Oh hey, speaking of fifth A drink's the last thing you need! Well, you might want one too, cause Pretty decent chance the baby's mine.
What?! What happened to a hundred-to-one?! I may have uh, massaged that number.
How can I show my face around town if Trudy Beekman will eat me alive for this! Decent chance.
Oh, oh, oh, and I can just forget all about getting on the board at the met! The museum or the opera? Either! Sterling Malory Archer, you are going to break in that vault and replace your blood with someone else's! Someone else's blood.
Yeah, great, I'll just have Igor bring a villager up to my castle.
Oh, Igor! Yeesss? Oh, evening sir.
Hello, mum! Woodhouse, what the hell is this?! It's a baby shower! What's it look like, ya puke? Ugh.
I think I could use a drink.
Sterling? Pick a villager.
Why did you let them in my house?! Because I told you to buy lemon curd, Woodhouse! Now what am I gonna spread on my toast? Your tears?! They just sort of barged in, sir Uh-huh.
And why are you barefoot?! Oh, you guys, it's so sweet.
I made that! It was gonna be a ham cozy, but then I was like "eh.
" So.
Well, he can use it as a blankie.
And eww.
What is this, homemade salad dressing? Breast milk.
I have my own.
So you won't need this.
It's some plastic dry cleaner bags.
Oh, and a book about SIDS.
Wh-?! What kinda shit gift is that?! Yeah, right? I made mine.
Me too! That's disgusting.
If I wanted to look at your bare feet, I'd sneak in and do it while you were asleep! Well? Have you picked out a donor? Yeah.
I dunno if it's the blood loss or what, but this whole thing feels Pretty stupid, Archer.
Getting a hooker pregnant? Yikes.
Cyril Oh, sorry, Ms.
Archer.
I'm sure the board at the met will frown on this.
I'm sure I don't care for your tone.
Well, I don't care to be judged by a couple of Lousy hooker-baby havers! You were saying? You get him drunk, I'll go to the drugstore and get some supplies.
But you said I could hold him you've been holding him and you've been drinking and yer hands are so damn big! Don't wantcha to, um, crush him.
No, but I'm gentle, I'm soft, give her the rabbit, Lenny.
Okay.
Thank Wow, somebody's got a full diaper, huh? Ugh.
And after that falafel, I am right behind him Did you see me? Holding the baby? Looked like Tyson holding that dove.
Listen, bitch Ah! Careful, 'cause, in about three drinks, you're gonna get all boohooey, ask me to pump a baby into you.
Wh-?! No, you guys should totally do that! The mochachino ones are the cutest! Guess he'd be half-gay too, though So can you say best dancer ever?! No! Thank you, but I don't care for any! Cyril, it's a toast.
Don't be rude.
No! Alcohol tends to exacerbate an underlying Personality disorder! Sexual addiction's not a real thing, asshole! Well, just wait'll the new DSM comes out! Then we'll see! We'll see you still being an asshole! So, uh have you ever thought about having a baby? I dunno.
Sometimes I think, ya know, I'd like to adopt a little baby So I could abandon it at the mall.
That answers my follow-up question.
Cyril, you're insulting me.
A toast! And what is it to toast about about, anyway?! How bout that "upper decker" I just left in the master bath? C'mon, Ray.
Sploosh, called it, three drinks ago.
C'mon, we both have amazing genes Nobody's arguing we're both hot, but Ray, you can do it! And I can watch! The door.
Like a lookout, so nobody sees ya doin' the dirt.
Oh, and also here's to child support! See ya around, Cyril.
And I'll see you at the lawyer's office, granny.
Toast, damn you! No! Toast! Jeezy petes, with you people! Well, at least I'm not a sex addict! And cue the collective sigh of relief.
Oh, shut up.
Hey, I just ran all the way to the drugstore a liter low on blood, so I am in no mood.
Oh, and I am? Cyril won't drink, so we'll have to find another way to Woodhouse, dear? Yes, mum? I assume you're holding? Holding? Er, why, just this tray of Don't bullshit me, you old dope fiend! After that scrape I got you out of?! Let's liven things up, Burroughs Five grams of junk says I can shoot a piña colada off your wife's head! my stomach's never been the same! I shall fetch my gear What the hell was that?! Who knows? I didn't have a sip of water the entire time I was down there.
No! Maybe it was an ice cube Woodhouse! He's a heroin addict?! Oh, listen to you, mister judgy! Now, go lure Cyril into the bathroom so we can drain his stupid blood.
Cyril, you are not to blame.
You are merely a victim of sexual addiction.
Cyril, you are not to blame.
Preaching to the choir, buddy.
And what's that supposed to mean?! It means, I understand, because I, too, suffer from sexual addiction.
Oh, you're just a, dirty stomp-around.
That's what society calls it! But you know how it is to be surrounded by women! Yes! Prancing around in their stirrup pants.
Crotchless panties.
I didn't know they had those.
Pretty sexy.
I have to take care of something! Medicine cabinet, Cyril, top left! Big bottle of coconut suntan oil! Man, I probably shouldn't be drinking this low on blood.
Whur you doona me? I brained him with the absinthe bottle.
Why? What was I to do, say "take a load off while we pump you full of heroin"? But if he was already knocked out?! Dear God, that was my entire stash! Going to be an itchy weekend Serves you right, smacky brown.
God, how are you even still alive? Holy shit, how am I still alive?! Eight gills is way more than I thought.
That's why you're so woozy.
Yeah, that, plus all those melon balls.
Had about nine of them.
Why the hell were you drinking?! Uh, hello?! It's a party?! It's a baby shower! For the bastard child you humped into a filthy whore! So I'm obviously not saying now, but one of these days, you are gonna make just the best grandma ever.
Oh my God These ODIN dicks Hey, where'd ya get your turtleneck? The turtleneck store? Wow, definitely missing that blood.
But maybe if I drank some of Cyril's blood, I'd Wait, what am I saying? I don't even know his blood type.
But I do know a liter of melon balls can't replace a liter of blood.
Because I'm kinda drunk for this oh nuts.
Fantastic.
What.
What're ya doin? Oh, ya know, just Livin the dream Lana.
Yeah? Well, I'm goin through yer stuff.
Why are you still in my house?! Eh, there's still a few stragglers here, tryna keep the party goin Cyril.
Hey, you awake? Cause this is about to get weird.
Ants! Oh! Oh! So shut up and help me find the nutmeg, and I'll make you some Malcolm x tea! And ya know what's frickin lame? Phased-plasma laser countermeasures? No, what's lame is you told me a jillion times ya never wanted kids, so I move on with my life, and then bam you drill one into a hooker.
Uh, it wasn't exactly planned, Lana.
Shut up.
But didja ever think about you and me, ya know, having a baby? No, not I mean, maybe that one time, when we had that little scare Wh-?! Is that a frickin candy bar?! Yeah, but think you need the calories? You are such a prick.
Who dragged out all this old crap?! Why are you and mother in my room, going through my things?! Because I'll save you some time My diary's by the Barbie playhouse, and the key's in a locket on Mr.
Teddy! My God, I haven't seen this junk in Look at that, his little baby shoes.
Can not picture him as a baby.
Ya know? I just see an adult him, but tiny.
Like a little Archer G.
I.
Joe.
You want me to freshen that up? Mm Try not to drown it.
Aww, his little christening gown Pam! You Get off Cyril! I was tryin to get him off! *** Out! Out, just get straight on out! Aw, c'mon! Cyril came on to me! Oh shut up! He's totally passed out! Really Hey, Cyril.
How's it hanging, buddy? His first pair of lacrosse cleats His first smoking jacket and, oh my His first black turtleneck! I can't believe Lana and mother.
No respect for people's privacy.
White ass daddy! Shit's tight, huh? Yo Where you at, mama? And why're you calling me right now?! I had to, before it's too late! I What?! I don't want you to do it, Sterling! What? I know you didn't plan on this baby, but Sterling, sometimes the unexpected things can turn out to be the most important things in the whole world! Wow, you sound shitfaced.
Oh, listen to you! Mr.
melon balls! And the yes, maybe I've had a few.
And even though I was not always mother of the year, I can change! And you can change, and maybe together we could add up to one good parent for this baby.
.
But I'm, like, right here And I'm right here for both of you.
Mother, I'm not sure I'm ready.
Sterling, no one's ever sure they're ready for a child.
That's why it's scary, and that's why it's so special.
So, please, dear, do the right thing.
God, the one time in my life she acts like a human being, and it's now? Was it when I wanted a puppy? No! Was it when I wanted cornrows? No! But maybe she's right I mean, the kid's cool, and I'm obviously awesome, so Maybe I would be a good father.
Ya know, at some point in the future.
Waaaagh! Waaaagh! Aww, you're okay, taterhead.
They only took a little bit of blood.
Yeah, quit being such a baby.
You quit bein such a baby! You prick! Shut up! They took a liter from me! And as the 24 hours of uninterrupted vault footage shows, said liter was never except for those nine frames of static there out of sight of ODIN personnel.
We get it.
Let's move on, Barry.
And since you all witnessed the blood sample being taken from the wee baby Seamus I hereby cede any and all rights to ever contest the results of this paternity test.
Move on, Barry! And, so, said test results conclude Exciting, isn't it? Not really, because it's gonna say that Archer is, in fact, the father! What?! Wait a minute! No, that's Probably the most expensive candy bar you ever ate, ya dunce! Really super expensive.
That's a schedule for child support payments? First of the month works best for us.
No, wait! Somebody coulda broken in the vault! C'mon, nine frames is a glitch! Because even if somebody did break into that vault, no one No one, Archer could ever prove it.
But And who'd even want to? Not a handsome, blond, cripple like me.
So, kudos, buddy! Let's go drink some kudos! Yeah, let's do that! Clink, clink! I don't understand how this happened.
Well, from what I can tell, it had something to do with disgustingly kinky sex and a candy bar, but A candy bar? Mother! I am not the father.
It was Cyril? That thing is huge.
I mean how did you even get you sonuva snack-eatin-ass bitch! I'm sorry! How can you cheat on Lana bareback?! I'm a sex addict! That's not even a real thing! And the guilt from sex makes me binge, then I feel fat, then I turn to sex to feel attractive again, then it's just this vicious cycle! Shitass.
Don't you see?! The wee baby Seamus is Cyril's! And Barry just wanted to frame me! You don't fool me.
You had the chance to make the switch, but you couldn't.
No, yes I could! And I never thought I'd say this, but Sterling You did the right thing.
No! I didn't! Well, the thing I thought was right, but not, ya know, what people think is right! Well, maybe you're turning into people.
But I don't wanna be people! And I didn't want to be a grandmother.
But c'est la vie, dear.
Yeah, and c'est la child support! Well, just tighten your belt.
My belt?! You said you were here for us! I am dear, but with the economy how it is What? My money isn't.
You're in a limousine! And if I wanted to sit around all day going nowhere, I'd be a teacher! Sorry dear, I have a fitting.
Ciao! Fitting.
And that's why people in this family shouldn't have children.
That, and a genetic predisposition toward Ants! Wh-?! Wretched horrible ants! Ants are gonna be the least of your worries, smackhound Running around barefoot like that? Hello, hookworms! Get in my feet! Or whatever.
Some kinda worms.
Will go in your feet.
Ahhh Oh man, is this great? - No Archer, it's - Was that a rhetorical question? - Archer Archer! - And also was that? Answer, yes, they both were, because New Orleans is my kind of town, and I haven't had a vacation in forever.
- LANA Well, that's great but - Nola! The Crescents City! - The Big Easy - Our mission is to stop an eco-terrorist from blowing up the biggest natural gas pipeline in North America, so I wouldn't exactly call it a vacation.
Well whatever, working vacation.
Cause I'm not too worried about some drum-circling hippie tree-hugger.
Sir, can you find your seat for me? Yeah it's right there.
Can you go find some more hurricanes for me? Hippies aren't the only people who care about the environment.
Like, I happen to care.
A lot.
And so does our target Joshua Gray, aka Gandalf.
His name's Gandalf? And he's not a hippie? Gray's an ex-Green Beret, and he's attacked nuclear power plants hydro-electric dams, wailing ships Wailing ships? What? He's against clean-burning lamp oil? Would you relax? We know he's gonna try to attack the pipeline, and we know where the pipeline is Yeah, running through a couple hundred miles of marshy wetlands.
So mobility will be key, Lana.
And how will we achieve mobility? Huh? An airboat, Lana! Just like Burt Reynolds in "White Lightning"! - Great, just - Not to mention "Gator"! Which, even though it's the sequel, I think is actually the stronger of the two films.
Just try to keep a low profile.
We could scare off Gray if we don't maintain the element of surprise.
Hey here's a surprise: This is Hermès.
Ooh, and here's another one.
- Remember Jerry Reed's character in Gator? - No.
Bama McCall? No.
Well whatever, check this out.
I stuh borrowed it from Woodhouse.
Archer, what the shit?! - Right? It's just like in Gator - Gun! Gun! Drop it, drop it! You drop it! Lana, hijacking! Dammit, it's not a Oh great, there better be more of those! Sky marshal! Drop your weapon! - Oh! Okay relax, it's okay, we're - Dut dut dut dut dut! Sterling Archer and Lana Kane of ISIS, and we're on a mission to stop an eco-terrorist from blowing up a gas pipeline! So for the love of God, woman, go make me a fresh batch of hurricanes! Great.
Way to keep a low profile.
Thanks.
This is the AmPetCo gas pipeline Runs right underneath these swamps, supplyin' almost twenty percent of America's liquid natural gas demand.
- Right - But there's a pig launcher here Is that what it sounds like? It's a pipe inspection gauge, for cleaning the pipeline.
It's the only section above ground, so if Gray wants to attack our pipeline He'll have to do it there.
So we'll set up a defensive perimeter at the launcher, and catch him when he tries.
Well wait, hang on a second Can I get the oyster po'boy and just like, a side of crawfish étouffee? Cause I'm not sure if I'll like it.
Archer.
No? Just an entree? Okay.
Oh, so the po'boyHello? - Wow, speaking of disastrous - Speaking of shut up, think about what will happen to those fragile wetlands if that pipeline explodes! Screw the damn swamps, think what'll happen to AmPetCo's profit margin! - What? - Big money.
Huge tax credits from that hippie Democrat congress, just for making a few simple changes around here.
Well, a lot of these aren't so simple.
Replacing all the lights with high efficiency fluorescents, putting lowflow fixtures on all the plumbing Recycling old batteries?! Exactly, don't we do that already? Umm - Prrretty much - Good.
Because I'm not leaving money on the table.
So to get these freebie socialist tax credits, we are going to make this place lean and green.
Typical corporate bullshit Thirty acres of wetlands disappear every day, but all you care about is how much natural gas you can pump out! Hey, we're just supplying a demand.
Yeah, AmPetCo's demand for huge profits! Well, some of those huge profits are paying ISIS to - protect that pipeline - Which I'm only doing for the wetlands - Wetlands, profits, whatever - Yeah, sounds like a win-win Just get out there and do your job! Yeah I will! If you will excuse me! I should go with her.
I don't think room service is coming.
Shoulda called first Cause dat's the only airboat around for fifty miles, and it's reserved.
What do you mean it's reserved? Is dat not self-explanatory? Look, this is kind of an emergency.
- Can we work something out? - Maybe.
Maybe use that money to buy a time machine, go back in time, and be the first person to reserve dat boat.
You sure about that? - Yup.
- Good.
Cause I've waited my entire life to say this exact phrase I'm commandeering this airboat.
Sorry! It really is an emergency! Of an awesome and asskicky nature.
And some damn guard dog you is! Annie! Annie? Aw, well that's just great.
Now both my dogs is dead! Stupid efficient Canadian lightbulbs.
I can barely even see what I'm doing.
What arya doin? I need six more of these.
Why do you need seven? One for each cat, duh! For God's sake, Pam! Have you no sense of decency?! That bathroom's like a, a war crime! Don't blame me, it's those new lowflow toilets! With the old ones you could flush a dachsund puppy! I mean, not that you would, but Well next time use the Dut dut dut dut! Women's restroom! The what? Thanks, Cyril.
Woooo! Seriously Lana, this must be what it's like to have sex with me! How can an airboat be selfish? Nope! Can't hear you, I'm too happy! You can't hear me because you're redlining the engine! Thank you, certified airboat mechanic! Now where's the pig launcher thing? This heading, one mile! - But I'm serious, if you don't slow down - I'll keep feeling this incredibly vibrant and alive! Yeah, right up until you blow the damn engine, so Lana! I am not gonna blow Try clearing your throat about a jillion more times, Lana, see if that helps.
No? Nothing? No no, by all means, let me do it You just sit there like the African Queen.
The African Queen was the boat.
- What? No it wasn't, it was Audrey - Katherine.
Whichever Hepburn, she was the queen.
Of Africa.
Yeah.
The white queen of Africa.
Yeah, back then Hollywood was pretty weird about the whole race thing Like, Amos and Andy were white, a white guy played Charlie Chan - Archer - Pretty sure Tonto was a Jew - Stop! What? ! Gator?! - Gator? - Talking! But I wish there was a gator! Hey c'mon, not even as a joke.
- It so wasn't.
- Look, I said I was sorry! Tell all this wildlife you're sorry when the pipeline blows up because we're not there to protect it! A, all this wildlife can suck it! Every thing out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria! And B No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.
Would you, just Okay, let's set up a defensive perimeter.
Yeah, right after I set up the grill.
- Dammit Archer, will you - Hey! I just dragged this damn boat through a mile of my three biggest fears, so I think I've earned a kabob! Well, too bad! Your lab uses more electricity than the rest of ISIS put together.
Yes, and I need every single watt! - No! - But, but I need We all have to pitch in to make ISIS green.
Loot at me, chopping ice for a Tom Collins like a field hand.
- But - Ooh, or do I want a mint julep? But the slightest reduction of power to my lab could put lives at risk! Lives of what, a few lab rats? Also, yes.
Yeah, good, great idea Do the one thing that could possibly make it hotter.
Ya gotta sear 'em first, it locks in the flavor.
And if you're hot, and also somewhat bitchy, drink a beer.
I don't want a beer, I want water.
Your funeral.
God knows what kinda parasites are swimming around in it.
Not swamp water, ass, bottled! - Oh you are shitting me - I know, right? A rainbow should shoot out every time you open it.
You didn't bring any water?! Where would I have put it? Great, I'll just wait half an hour for a cup of ice to melt.
- Dut dut dut dutm dut.
- Oww, shit! What the [BEEP] shit is this? No, no, no, Lana.
It's dry ice! Hurry, put your hands in the swamp! Rrrgh! How ya doin, buddy? Because dry ice is something crazy like, negative a hundred degrees I need you, to not talk to me.
I know, and I know you're in a lot of pain, so just try to relax Why are you still talk ow! And say hi to Sister Morphine.
Morphine?! Dammit, I don't need That actually feels waaaay better.
- Yeah? - Yeahhhh That actually feels better.
Good, then get up.
You're sitting on the beer.
Alright, so wait a second.
What're your three biggest fears? Nope.
- C'mon - No, hush, I'm trying to fish.
No, don't shoot the fish.
C'mon, this is a very fragile ecosystem.
Too fragile to spare one trout? No, but Or bass or whatever, what's in here? Nothing soon, if people like you keep destroying the environment.
Wh-?! It's one lousy fish! One lousy black rhino, one lousy Bengal tiger One lousy Lorax! Since when are you such a radical environmentalist? I'm not radical.
Well, I mean not anymore.
Back in the day, though Fur is murder! Fur is murder! Fur is murder! Fur is murder! How's it feel to be a murderer?! Shall we find out? Lady, you don't scare me MALORY Dear, this is a forty-four magnum.
- You're really not scared, are you? - Newp.
Then how would you like a job? Three weeks later I was in Tunisia, killing a different man And how and why is that funny? Not that, I forgot about that afro.
Hey, ya know what? I know you looked like Angela Davis had a lovechild with Sweet Lou Dunbar.
Shut up You shut up, I'm trying to catch us some dinner.
- Well, if you'd brought enough food - I wouldn't have had room - for beer, and I since I can't catch beer - Or a fish.
Yes I can.
Burt Reynolds is my spirit-guide.
Did you say man-crush? No, I'm pretty sure it was shut up.
What're your three biggest fears? Getting stuck on a boat with you three times.
Ooh, here we go.
C'mere fishy, fishy.
And while you eat humble pie with a side of crow, Lana I'll be dining on trout.
Waaaaagh! What the hell is that?! What the hell does it look like?! Shoot it! Shoot it! ARCHER Oh, so now it's okay?! What happened to your fragile ecosystem?! Screw the damn ecosystem, shoot! You are such a hypocrite! I bet you probably eat veal! Did you see that?! And hear that, what is that, what's that sound? Oh you are shitting me How did you shoot the boat?! Because I was bucking around like a rodeo clown in a barrel! Well did you hit the gator?! I dunno! - I mean, maybe - Great, so maybe he's wounded.
No, he's definitely wounded.
Oh right, I forgot he has an arrow, sticking out of his head! Yeah I think that's what enraged him.
And so now all twenty enraged feet of him is swimming around out there - In that inky black water - Into which we are currently sinking.
Yeah, it's not ideal.
I mean, even if we had more shells, You only brought two shells?! No, I brought shitloads, thank you! Well where are they?! In the gear bags With your guns.
And everything else.
Still got the cooler though, so Thank God for small miracles, huh? Lana.
Lana.
Lanaaaa! What?! I said thank God for small miracles.
I heard you.
I know.
Yeah, why dontcha have another one? Well, somebody's got to.
- And since you refuse to help - You don't need help to get drunk! Oh please, it takes more than some three-two Or, wow, six percent beer to get Sterling Archer drunk.
Six, really? Yeah, so lay off! There's a giant wounded alligator out there, not to mention a dangerous - eco-terrorist - Holy shit, totally forgot about him.
I didn't But that's even more reason for you to get on board with my new plan! Is it as idiotic as your other plan? That's how brainstorming works, Lana! - It's free-form, you come up with a lot of ideas - Yeah, like using the pipeline to set the entire swamp on fire.
Which, yes, bad idea, but it got me thinking about chemical reactions! Like alcohol's effect on the brain? No, like the reaction between solid carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice, of which we have plenty And a fun, sexy little molecule I like to call di-hydrogen monoxide.
- Water? - Water.
Combine them in a sealed container - and you've got yourself - Some kind of dry ice bomb? Arrgh, yes, ruiner of explanations.
I was building to that, but yes.
Well, we got plenty of water.
No, the swamp's too dirty, it's full of whatever alligators shit out - which I can only assume it's people.
- They don't eat people.
- They eat people all the time.
- They don't.
Last year, Sarasoni County Florida, Chett Willer, age 16, swimming in the Oak River Canal, killed by an 11 footer.
Two years ago, *** County, Georgia, Ruth Baker, age 39, killed in her back yard by a 10 footer.
Same year, Pinellas County Florida, Walter Jakes, age 70, and his dog, killed by a 12-footer.
- Three years ago, Dade County - Archer! What?! What are your three biggest fears? Archer? Alligators, by far the biggest.
And so you've memorized every fatal alligator attack? Just in the U.
S.
, I can't find any information on tacks in China.
They only live here and China.
Two different species.
Chinese alligators are smaller, but their bellies are fully-armored so it kind of equals out and Can we change the subject?! Okay, what's your second biggest fear? God, will ya just it's crocodiles! Wait, do crocodiles even live here? Not here-here, but in the Everglades.
That's like, a thousand miles away.
Well, three years ago they caught a 9-foot croc in the surf at Myrtle Beach so, ya know shit happens.
Wow.
Not sure I even wanna know what your third-biggest fear is - Brain aneurysm.
- What? What does a brain aneurysm have to do with walking around in a swamp?! Nothing, it can happen anywhere.
At any time.
That's why it's terrifying.
Oh my God okay, okay, so if the gator-poop water is too dirty Yeah, we need distilled water.
Does your plan include finding some? Yes.
But.
But what.
You're not gonna like it.
Do we have to distill our pee? I guess you can if you want.
- But I was just gonna use this - There was bottled water in there the whole time?! Yeah, I just forgot.
You forgot.
Thanks, idiot! What, you still would've burned your hands reaching in here! Idiot! I hope an alligator attacks you at the exact second you have a brain aneurysm.
How could you even say that?! That's like me saying I hope you get cancer! What the hell is wrong with you?! I obviously don't! But holy shit, Lana I pour my heart out, and you just throw it right back in my face? - Sorry.
- Well, you should be.
That's wait, okay, what's your biggest fear? - Newp.
- Come on, I told you mine! I know.
You lose.
- I think your biggest fear is intimacy - Ha.
When what you should be afraid of is falling in love with me again because of my awesomeness.
Check this out.
Wait, how do you light it? You don't, the pressure just builds up until it explodes.
How long does that take? Depends on how much water you add, we're gonna need to dial it in.
So you have no idea when that's gonna go off.
How could I? Aw, shit! - Asshole.
- Did it getcha? - No! - Me neither.
- Wow, again, small - Don't! - Miracles.
- Rrgh! How long was that? Oh I'm sorry, I forgot to time it! It's okay, I forgot to measure it.
So we're both gonna need to do better.
Every single one! To hell with the tax credits, I want every last one of those low-flow toilets out! Dump them on the street with those ridiculous light bulbs.
Why do I have to carry the toilets? You know why.
Because of the things that come out of your body.
Oh shut up.
Mister Bigmouth, telling her we have a women's bathroom.
Where I better never catch you again! Okay! Jeez, hostile work environment.
Yeah, so everything's back to normal.
Is it?! I told you lives were at risk! Now behold the horror you have wrought! And Pam? If you're dumping stuff on the street? This can all go.
- What is it? - Shattered dreams.
Smells like rotten meat.
Also, yes.
Yeah, there we go! Okay, I think we've got the recipe figured out! Yeah, that was actually pretty great.
- Duh! - Shut up! - You shut up! Okay, I'll get dry ice in the rest of the bottles, you be ready with the water, and we'll wait for that big fat stupid gator to come back.
Destroying his habitat isn't enough? What? I would've been here sooner, but you stole my boat.
Do you not understand how reservations work, or? Reserve this, Treebeard! Oh please, it's not even loaded.
- Wh-? Thanks Lana.
- Shut up.
- Hi, Josh.
- Hello, Lana.
You know each other?! Josh was my Environmental Policy T.
A.
When I was in college.
And her lover Also, yes.
Wait, I thought he was a Green Beret! I went to grad school on the G.
I.
bill.
And that's when I realized I had to lead the fight against the systematic rape of Mother Nature.
But back then you just organized peaceful protests Like that day at the fur store where you disappeared without a trace.
I guess I kinda found my calling.
What, as a hired gun for the military- industrial complex? A traitor to the cause of environmental protection? Me? ! What about you?! - Always running around, blowing shit up - Threatening our supply - of lamp oil - Shut up, but Josh seriously, do you really think the ends justify such violent means? Yes! Because this is a war! And victory will only come when Americans will stop destroying the Earth just so they can drive bigger cars, build bigger houses, and eat bigger food! - So like, never.
- Yeah.
- Oh my God, that's depressing - Sorry.
And I'm also sorry we can't let you blow up this pipeline.
I wasn't going to.
Well then why I mean I was, but I saw you with this idiot, yelling on the plane about working for ISIS.
So technically I saved the pipeline! Yeah, you're the best.
ARCHER Whatever, I win.
Suck it, Samwise.
- Archer - So, you need a lift back to land? - Yeah, lemme just grab my cooler and - Not you! Ass.
Lana? Maybe we can grab dinner, see some Dixieland jazz? That sounds lovely.
Oh c'mon, are you kidding me?! You're really gonna leave me out here?! Yup! I like your new hairdo, by the way.
Well if you like the collar, you're gonna love the cuffs Well that's just great.
She gets dinner and Dixieland and laid, and I get mosquitos and no beer and not laid.
How could this get any w Lemme finish, worse? Now, okay see, you ruined it.
You ruined the moment.
Woodhouse, what the hell is this?! I believe it is squash, sir.
I what're you shoveling it into?! The wee baby Seamus.
Miss Trinette said you'd agreed to it, while she's in Atlantic City for the weekend What?! For the "Pimps and Ho's Ball," I believe she said.
Didn't seem the sort of place one takes a baby.
You realize you're in huge trouble Yessir And that now I have to spend my first Friday off in like, forever Yessir Devising some bizarre punishment for you.
Yessir.
So don't be surprised if you end up eating a whole bunch of spiderwebs.
Right? Now shut up and read me the paper.
Very good, sir, let's see what we Good Lord! Oh for what the shit, Woodhouse?! Stop crying! How do you make him not God, here! Ya like that? That's a Bloody Mary.
Or is it a Bloody Caesar?! Why're you sitting? At my table?! I the paper sir, there's an item Oh yeah? Did somebody finally out the Queen? Right? This baby know what I'm talking about.
Gimme that.
Sir Augustus Stilton, World War One flying ace, blah blah blah, dies under mysterious circumstances.
And mystery solved, he was a thousand.
Stilton and I were squadron-mates Oh.
Sorry.
Twenty-Two Squadron, RFC.
Most decorated aerodrome of the Great War.
I don't care about the great war.
But not much left of the old Double Deuce anymore.
We're all dying off Yeah, not a huge surprise.
We're not dying of old age, sir Wait a second.
Sir Alfred Wensleydale, foul play suspected Nigel Buxton, mysterious circumstances Edwin Glue-sester Gloster Whatever, foul play suspected another "mysterious circumstances, every one of these is like that, and they're all from the past six months.
What the hell? Hell indeed, sir.
Because one at a time, the remaining survivors of the old Double Deuce are being murdered.
Oh my God.
Are we out of Bloody Marys?! Can not picture you as a fighter pilot.
Oh no sir, not a pilot.
A batman.
An officer's personal attendant.
In charge of keeping his kit in good order, seeing to his personal needs So, a servant.
"Soldier-servant" was the official term, but Yeah, Way to advance.
But for the enlisted, being chosen to bat for an officer was very desirable.
Especially when that officer was Captain Reginald Thistleton.
I say, Woodhouse! Yessir.
The Hun did a fair job of stitching up the old kite this time, what? Thank God you're alright, sir.
God and my twin Vickers, caught old Jerry in a chandelle, poor bastard went down like a quail.
You scoundrel! Is that brandy?! Thought you'd like a pick-me-up, sir.
You're a rose among thorns! Bagged your share today, Scripes? Loads, thanks! See you've already bagged yours Creepy Yes, Leftenant Scripes abhorred the way Reg Er, Captain Thistleton carried on with the men.
Yeah, didn't Oscar Wilde get hard labor for that? For what are you talking about? I'm what're you talking about? The tontine France.
Spring, 1917.
Bloody April, they called it Black days, they were.
We were losing two, sometimes three pilots a week.
Who was that? Foxley, I should think.
No one thought we'd live through the war, so Reggie came up with the idea.
A tontine, lads! Each man pays in fifty pounds, and the last survivor collects the capital and interest.
Oh come on lads, show some stones! I'll show you my stones, sir! That's the spirit! Who else? Well done Johnny, Bob's your uncle.
So, how much are we talking here? Oh, nearly twelve hundred pounds.
What?! Nobody's getting killed over how ever much that is in real money! Well no, but are you familiar with the term "compound interest?" I'm not an idiot, Woodhouse.
Unlike some people around here! That's silvertip badger! You know how much this cost?! No no, hey c'mon, don't Here, God, Baby.
But since I don't have a calculator At ten percent, by now I'd say it's just a bit shy of a million dollars.
What?! I would totally kill you for that! Not me, but ya know, somebody would So how many of you geezers are left? Well, now that's Stilton's been killed, it's just me, Scripes, and And that'll be Stinky.
Wh-? What will?! Cor, you done alright then.
Oh, no, the flat belongs to Mr.
Archer, who is my None of my business Consenting adults and so on.
Hey, nobody's consenting to anything! None of my business! You're gonna eat so many spiderwebs That's what he said Scripes phones me at my niece's house in Secaucus, New Jersey I live with my niece in Secaucus, New Jersey Riveting Says innit it awful about Stilton, and he wants to come pay us a visit! Good Lord! What'd you say?! Gave 'im your address! Told the bastard we'd be waitin for 'im! Waiting for him?! My God, he'll Never know what hit 'im! We'll turn this fruity flat into a killing field! But Seamus, no! Huh-uh! Woodhouse, I can either do God, you are such a little brat! Here! I can do baby, or I can do "geezer murder mystery," but I can't do both.
Well Scripes is on his way here, so So sir? Perhaps your mother could look after the wee baby Seamus? Woodhouse, yes.
No! Yes! Mother c'mon, you said you You're off your nut if you think I'm babysitting this squawling little What the hell is wrong with him?! He miight have a tiny hangover.
Wh-? You ass, you gave him liquor?! No, I didn't give it to him, but Ass.
See, look at him he's just crazy for it.
You're only supposed to give them liquor if they have the croup! Well I'm sorry Mister Spock, I Or colic! Or the jimmy-legs! Or can't you just dump him on Woodhouse? No, because That's what I always did.
I am sure you did, but apparently Woodhouse is about to be murdered, So are you, if you piddle in here! And that goes double for number two, Mister Man! So you just hold it in! Wow.
A ton of stuff just started making sense to me.
The secret is negative re-enforcement.
Yeah, I'm just getting that.
About time.
Ass.
Baby, you're pear shaped.
Oh, what the hell! Hello?! Great, that was my second-favorite lamp.
Reloading! No you're not! Don't reload.
Dammit! Ow.
And my first-favorite lamp, fantastic.
Serves you right, shooting blind like that.
You could've killed me.
Yeah, and I'd be that much closer to a million bucks! Ya know, once um What's up with your will the days? Oh my God Since when is this place a nursery?! Wouldja knock it off, Union Carbide?! And lay off the wee baby Seamus.
He's got it tough enough as it is Wussat! A pwetty bumblebee! Ya wanna pwetty bumblebee? There you go! Aww, wassamatter? What happened? Did somebody trick you? Hm? See? That's how the world works, dear and I'm the only one you can trust.
Wow A ton of stuff just started making sense.
No way.
Why not? Mr.
Archer said Woodhouse might make a million bucks from his! Shut up, liar.
Of things impossible.
It's not Cyril, can you explain compound interest to her? Maybe if we had an infinite amount of time.
And she were someone else.
Muh huh huh huh.
Wait a second, is that a you know tontines are illegal, right? So is all kindsa shit! But lookit these odds! Half the people that work here are field agents, Who get killed in the line of duty all the time! And the control room Is basically just a great big asbestos lawsuit waitin to happen Yeah, here's some more claims forms And how long ya think this one's gonna be around? Yeah.
Yeah, count me in.
No.
Yes! We must fortify our position! We need twin Vickers here by the bar, a Lewis gun by the sofa Mustard gas! Zeppelins! No! The guy's a hundred, he'll probably break both his hips pushing the doorbell.
I don't know, sir.
Scripes was the toughest man in the squadron Just the squadron, or the entire Pansy Division? Ow! By God, you will show some respect! Do as you like with me, but I won't have a swishy party-boy backchat a war hero! War hero? Oh, let's not Who, Woodhouse?! Damned right! *** And if you won't tell him, Woodhouse, I bloody well shall! Alas, poor ReggieHe was on his way back from a routine patrol.
It was a Tuesday afternoon I'd written him a letter, you see, so I was waiting out on the field And he was looking at me - my God, I can still see his smile - when that Hun bastard dove in from behind And then the sky just shattered.
God knows how, but he kept the old kite from rolling over And crash-landed, out in No Man's Land And?! Hm? Then what?! Oh.
Well, Reggie survived the crash somehow Aaagh! I survived the crash somehow! So we could've sent a rescue party.
But with Reggie hors de combat, Scripes had become acting commander And there shan't be any rescue party.
Captain Thistleton knew the risk of what he was doing, and now it seems his chickens have come home to roost.
Bawk bawk, a response I found unsatisfactory.
I could hear Reggie, out there past the wire, screaming like a lamb Aaaagh! I'm coming for you, sir! And there I found him, in the words of Henley, "bloodied but unbowed.
" Woodhouse, you came for me! Of course I did, sir! I'm a Fag? Sir? Have you got one? Dying for a smoke Oh! Yes of course sir, here we are Cheers.
Now let me just light that for you Oops.
Sorry, sir Just give that another go Good man.
Damn! Good God, man, are you hourly? I sorry, sir, I here we go.
Woodhouse God, that's bright there's something I've been wanting to tell you, but You scoundrel! Izzat brandy?! Oh, no sir, just water Water?! No, never touch the stuff, fish [BEEP] in it.
But seriously I've wanted to tell you this for ages, but I never quite knew how I'm listening, sir Woodhouse Fish [BEEP] in it.
After that, it's all a bit fuzzy.
Reggieeeeeeeee! And then what? Then they gave me the VC and my papers medical discharge.
Because of the scalps.
Oh for The what?! German scalps! Must've been fifty of 'em! Could've made a blanket.
And then I just sort of drifted about.
Spent God knows how many years in the Orient, on a merchant schooner Reggieeeeeeeee! Then I sort of washed up in Tangiers, where I won a bar in a dice game Which is how I met your mother.
Don't shoot! Please.
I just killed a man and I think my water just broke.
So I could really, really use a drink.
Gave birth to you right there on that greasy bar.
I cut the cord, and I've been with your family ever since.
The you Oh my God, you you saw Mother's vagina?! Oh, my God! Aaah! Oh my God.
Rrrghh! What an ass.
Right? Mother?! Mother, where are you?! In here you half wit! I had just gotten him to sleep! Don't you know anything about babies?! I know you're not supposed to have 'em on a greasy bar! In Tangiers! Oh my God And I know you're not supposed to let Woodhouse see your lady parts! Wh-? That's why you're so upset?! Yes! Eww! Mother he touches my food! Darling, he also Give me that! He also saved my life.
And yours.
Between my narrow hips, your fat head, and a city full of enemy spies We both nearly died that night They're sure to come here looking.
We should get you somewhere safe.
Oh, a few minutes more.
I just want to look at him.
Isn't he perfect? Aye.
Here, Miss for the lad.
It's beautiful A clapped-out old whore traded it for a pint.
Said it was sterling.
Sterling.
That's what I'll name him! Oh, that's a fine name.
And could could his middle name be Reginald? No.
Little too gay, but Nicht bewegen! Sie sind verhaftet! But how would you like a job? I I think I would like it very much indeed, mum.
Oh my God And if that weren't enough, that very night he traded his bar for a boat and sailed us to Lisbon.
Got me to an OSS safehouse, sold the boat, used the money to get you both back home to States, then raised you by himself for five years! Wwwhaat? You heard me, young man.
Your mother's just home from the war, boy.
Give her a proper hello.
No! I don't have a mother! And if I did, I'd I'd hate her! Wow, he did all that? For You.
And you treated him like a dog ever since.
But you won't have him to kick around forever Oh shit! Woodhouse! Oh my God, he's gonna be murdered! I gotta go save him! Ah ah ah! Here.
You want me to take a baby.
To a murder.
Or wherever, just out of here.
I have no more love to give today.
Yeah what is it, like, two-thirty? Wait, why'd you have an eyepatch? Oh, who remembers? Three large, three-large fitty, threelarge a Benjamin, three-large Idiots, doing idiot things because they're idiots Yeah, we're the idiots.
Says the genius who got a hooker pregnant What? Nothing! Cyril, what? Cyril? You dead? Damn.
Should I put him out of his misery? Nehh Do you, though.
I No, wait, then I won't get the money.
Idiot.
You'll never take us alive, Scripes! What do you mean, take you alive, Woodhouse I only came here to Wh-?! Bloody hell! Ow.
Dreadfully sorry about that, old boy.
Bloody should be.
Almost killed me.
Which again, from the bottom of my heart, is the last thing on earth I'd ever want to do.
I'd forgotten all about that rubbish tontine But All the mysterious deaths I daresay there's not much mystery They're just desperate to sell newspapers.
Gloucester fell off the roof mucking about with the aerial, Wens and Bux died in their sleep at the pensioners' home.
And as for Stilton There's no nice way to put it.
Auto-erotic asphyxiation.
You're joking! No.
Stilton was always quite keen on that.
Remember? Always looking for something sturdy to loop his Sam Browm ne over? I do seem to recall an awful lot of loose doorknobs.
Oh, plus what he named his plane.
I always thought that had something to do with the engine.
Well Here's to you, "Choke and Stroke.
" To "Choke and Stroke!" And here's to the old Double Deuce.
God knows we had our differences, but it was I'm just, I'm just so glad to see you both.
But if you didn't come to kill us, why bring that whacking great Webley? It's Reggie's.
I stole it from his effects.
I looked everywhere for that Damned wretched of me, but I just wanted a memento.
But Reggie would've wanted you to have it, old boy I say, that's damned decent of you.
Cheers.
Took good care of her, too.
Look.
No rust.
Even the barrel's clean.
Noooooooo! Look ouuuuuuuuuut! Oh my Gawwwwd! The baybeeeeee! Rrrrgh! Nooooooo! I'm coming, Reggieeeeee! Whooo! What a move! Did you see that? That was like, like Steve McQueen and John Woo had a baby, and that baby was you, baby.
Yeah pretty hot, huh? Oh my God! You, you! No, don't thank me, thank the Ass! Unbelievably gigantic! Ass! Hey! Scripes wasn't here to kill us! He came to mourn our comrades-in-arms! Oh.
Oh?! That's all you have to say, you great flapping twit?! Oh?! Hey! Seriously Corporal Bishop! Give him the Webley! The what? What's a web Thank you, Corporal Bishop.
The pleasure was all mine Lance Corporal Woodhouse.
Damn shame he'll send you packing when he comes to.
Oh, I'll just yank his pants off, splash a lot of scotch and women's underthings about then tell him he slipped and fell, chasing a terrified Asian prostitute out onto the patio.
It's not the first time I bashed his head in and had to cover my tracks.
Happens three, four times a year - Roy? - Well Guess you and me are the last two left in the tontin, eh? Yeah.
I guess we are.
Hard to believe, eh? Well, we were the two youngest.
No, no, not that.
The fact that the Government let you two fruit batch adopt the baby.
I am the target.
I am the target.
I am the target.
Then go already! Ya big bag with which one douches.
I'm sorry, what's that? I can't hear you Over the sound Of my deafening awesomeness.
Women Oh, I hate him so much.
Three hundred bucks, ladies! Come render the salad unto Caesar! Whoa whoa whoa! Huh-uh! We're still in the lead.
Well yeah, but just by one.
And? And Cyril's got three throws left to get two measly points! For the win.
Exactly.
Are you shitting me?! Will you shut up?! Ignore him, forget those first two darts, and just find your center.
Maybe it's in your vagina C'mon, Cyril! Whassa matter? Can't perform under pressure? I Could you repeat that, please? Onomotopoeia.
O, N, O, M O, T, O Pee? Geezie Petes.
You idiot! How could you miss that?! How could he not? He's Cyril! C'mon ladies, I'm buyin! Way to go, Chokely Carmichael.
Hey Pam, wait up! C'mon, get me drunk enough, and I might have sex with you.
Really?! No, it's a Catch-22.
The amount of alcohol I'd need would literally kill me.
But I do wanna see how many pool balls can fit in your mouth.
My record's three Come on, buddy You want a drink? Not even some vinegar and water?! With friends like that, eh? Hm? Your friends.
Well, they're not really my friends, we just work togeth Oh, hello ISIS, you said? I No, I didn't say that.
Well, somebody must've.
Champagne? George, by the way.
George Spelvin.
Cyril Figgis.
And thank you.
Neh, thank me tomorrow After Cyril Figgis saves the day.
I dunno what Mother's so mad about, but God, Pam, would you hurry up? Would you shut up?! Frickin head's poundin, I'm sweatin booze, and my mouth is killin me.
You're the one who stuffed four pool balls in it.
Personal best! Your mother must be so proud Yeah, oh wait, she's dead.
And what's up with your mother? What comes after infuriated? Great, that's what I need, coming off a blackout drunk.
Yeah, the last thing I remember was I don't know, were we super-bitchy to Cyril? Yeah, that sounds about right.
Great, now he's gonna be moping around like Droopy Dawg on downers for Morning, gang! Jeez Archer, what's got your mom so darn worked up? This! Krieger? And the damn thing is spreading! To every computer in the office! Do you think this is funny?! Do you not? Nobody can do any work! Yeah, so can we go home? Absolutely! Right after you idiots de-worm the entire computer network! How're we supposed to do that?! Well, I could take a crack at it Don't! Touch it! Cyril! Go do whatever it is you do Like suck at stuff.
And leave this to people who are more qualified.
At not sucking at stuff.
Cyril, beat it! Krieger is on this! I think.
I mean, least I have a Hunch, hunch! What, what?! Ahem.
Inappropriate.
What do you mean? No, I mean the first part worked.
I snuck into the mainframe last night, after all the champagne and the, uh Handjobs.
Yeah, The twins are quite fond of you.
I loaded that into the mainframe Splendid! Then open your dish! But part two, where I use your secret code to kill the worm and kinda, be the hero for once, that didn't happen.
Don't worry about it, open your dish.
No thanks Cyril.
I got that specially for you, and quite frankly you're insulting me.
Now open.
Your dish.
Sorry George, I didn't mean to be George there's money in there! Oh good, for a second I thought they'd brought you chicken toes or something.
George why is there money in there?! Cyril, I've been just a teeny bit less than honest with you.
Oh no No now, it's nothing sinister.
I design computer security systems.
CIA, MI-6, ODIN, all the biggies.
You must be pretty good at it.
Too good, that's the problem.
My systems can't be hacked, so now I can't convince anyone to upgrade.
Which is why I designed this.
And thanks for helping me test it.
If it's that easy on an XL-9 network like the one at ISIS, I think I can convince my clients they're at risk.
Wh-? ! What kind of risk?! Not from this! It's just a cute little pirate.
But it shows there are flaws out there that can be exploited.
By bad people.
Trust me, it's for the greater good.
Yeah, I guess it just seems Look, if you're uncomfortable taking the fifty grand, I'll just No no! Fifty grand? - Wow No, I mean, as long as it's for the greater good - Oh, it is.
And as long as I can still, ya know, swoop in and save the day OK That might be a problem.
Ya think?! I do.
Because now the worm is in the mainframe databanks, and Dammit, Pam! Sorry! I was just checkin to see if it's still doin it! Of course it's still doing it! "Hunch, hunch!" What, what? Pam! That's not me! Yes it is! Pam, I swear to God! Yeah, quit screwing around, Pam! This is serious.
Very.
Because if the worm gets into the mainframe's encrypted files Holy shit! The identity of every single ISIS field agent is on there! So what? Because most secret agents don't tell every harlot from here to Hanoi that they are secret agents! Then why be one? "Hunch, hunch! What, what?" Just turn off the mainframe! Yeah, we tried that Then how is it still on?! Because the worm has transformed the mainframe into a sentient being! What?! I'm kidding, there's a battery backup.
Yeah.
Over there.
Behind about two tons of steel, and one electronic lock.
Which is controlled by the mainframe.
Well what genius thought that up?! This one.
Sorry! And where the hell have you been? On agency business.
At the bank.
Sesame Ginger Savings and Loan? What's all this? This, is the backbreaking work we've been doing, while you were getting takeout from your stupid Chinese bank! Every single one of these has to be wiped, reformatted, the whole shmeel.
What? But it's just a little cartoon pirate! Was.
But it mutated, and now we're like, on the brink of World War Two.
Three.
It's not a competition, Pam! Well, is it or isn't it?! I don't know! I mean, the mainframe thinks they're nuclear missile launches, but it's so screwed up "Hunch, hunch! What, what?" Sorry! Case in point, there's really no way to be sure.
So what am I supposed to do, just look out the window?! No, you don't wanna be anywhere near a window.
Same thing in a tornado.
And they can't even turn off the stupid mainframe because some stupid battery thing is in some stupid vault.
But they don't need to turn off the Darn it, I can fix this! Oh please, he couldn't fix dinner.
He doesn't need to, with a bank like Not a real bank.
Dammit! Sorry But I have no idea how to open this thing.
Not really my legerdemain.
You mean bailiwick? I dunno, whatever, look out.
What're you Archer, no! For the love of God, man! You massive ssshole! I'm sorry, I thought that would work! Really.
No, look at that thing.
It's like it's made out of Wolverine's bones.
You know Cause they're Does nobody read X-Men?! So hey, how about I take a crack? I bet I can kill that pesky old worm.
How? Ya gonna disappoint it to death? Hey, ya know what?! Yes, I do.
Beat it Cyril, let the grown-ups work.
But leave this, I'm starving.
No! Gimme that! Hey, wait a damn minute! I said I was hungry.
Great.
Rrrrungh! There, now we don't have to re-format all those stupid things.
- Brilliant.
- Right? Totally.
Because how's the elevator supposed to work with a jillion pounds of frickin computers on it?! Who am I, Elisha Otis? C'mon, pick up pick up pick up Cyril.
What's going on with you? Nothing's going on! Hi, you've reached George Spelvin, por Espanol Hated that phone.
Always dropping calls.
Probably holding it wrong.
Oh yeah, just like Cyril Figgis always does everything wrong, is that what you mean?! Basically.
Well for your information, Cyril Figgis knows how to beat the worm! I bet.
The computer worm! Krieger can't even beat it! Krieger, who's virtual girlfriend is so real the state of New York is allowing him to legally marry her! Oh, Kureega-san! Soon we will to be married, yes? Very soon, my little cherry blossom Would you please! Focus! Nooooo! Kureega-san! Nooooo! You maniac! You blew her up! Oh, damn you! God damn you all to hell! So how's this going? Not great.
The worm's decrypting the ISIS agent list and then, apparently, it's going to upload them to an off-site server.
Oh my God Plus now I'm going to die alone.
And once the worm decrypts the cover list and uploads it - to whoever is behind this foul deed - every ISIS agent in the field will be exposed.
And probably killed.
Oh my Archer, do something! Who am I, Alan Turing? Also from X-Men.
Sterling! What?! Are we keeping you from something? No.
Well? Well what? Cyril was just right here Like, one second ago.
So where are we, what's the plan? I'm going to sell it.
The Russians, maybe the North Koreans famine or no, they've got a shitload of money.
But you can't do that! One moment, darlings Of course I can.
Once my little worm uploads the list to my server.
But it's not yours! You stole it! Bought it.
From you.
Well, then sell it back to me! Can't.
You just said you could! Well "won't" then, whatever.
Look.
Take the money back! Here's the almost fifty thousand! Count it! You'd still be about three zeros short.
Fifty million?! Seller's market.
But that's not fair oww! It is exactly fair! You made a choice! And just like every other choice that every other human being has ever made, it has a consequence! But I just wanted to show them I could Them?! Or maybe your father, who never thought you quite measured up! He how did you know that? - Just a guess really.
- Okay okay, what if what if I get you the fifty million? One is inclined to ask how.
Well I happen to be a kickass accountant! Did that sound a lot better in your head? Yes it did.
Damn, thas over half the cover list! Krieger, we don't have much time! Can you stop the worm or not?! Oh I thought we were putting all our eggs in the battery-shutdown basket.
No, it could take hours for this thing to bypass the electronic lock! Well then I better get my turtleneck.
Archer! Hey so, uh you busy? Yes! Or no, I dunno.
Who's asking? You, Cyril, are a [BEEP] idiot! I just wanted to show everybody I could perform under pressure! And just for once, be the guy who oww! Who what?! Betrays the agency?! And then begs me to save you?! No, not me! All those field agents! Rrgh! How much did he pay you? Fif orty thousand? Cyril.
Fifty thousand.
Mine.
- But I already spent like, three thousand on new suits, and shoes and - Mine.
Take the suits to my tailor and the shoes to my shoemaker.
You have a shoemaker? Do you not? I am unbelievably angry right now.
That's good, you should channel that.
Onto Spelvin, whose fault this is.
Shut up and break it down for me.
You've been inside, what's the layout? Well, let's see uh, it's pretty big What's the floorplan! Where's the primary ingress! Orientation! Are there windows, do they face west, can we use the sun to our advantage?! I'm pretty sure it has windows Gimme the gun.
No, why? We're here, idiot.
Oh.
Once you're in, give this to Spelvin.
It's full of counterfeit bearer bonds.
Where'd you get counterfeit bearer bonds.
Don't open it! There's a canister of knockout gas wired to the latch.
Cool Duh.
Okay, try not to screw Wait, it's just Spelvin up there, right? Um Cyril.
There's probably two incredibly sexy Asian women in bikinis? Oh.
I'm suddenly much less angry.
Well, you say that Dammit, the worm's got the list! How long will it take to upload it to the server?! I dunno, maybe five hours? Oh good, then we've got some time Or minutes, look I'm a little busy.
Gettin back in the ol' dating game.
Yep! Fifty million dollars in real bearer bonds! Which are um, real.
Unbelievable.
Well, like I said Literally.
I don't believe you.
Just open it up and look! At what, Cyril? A big spritz of knockout gas? Apparently not.
Exactly! Because I don't even know if that's a real thing! Okay, Spelvin, where's the ISIS cover list? Over there, on the server.
Where's the Hellooo, kitties Listen, if you're not busy after, we should go grab a drink or Wh-?! Dammit, Cyril! Remember to channel it! You said they were sexy! Ninjas are sexy! Right? I mean I think so.
Look, I don't want to hurt you ladies So how about we all just put our swords down and You don't have a sword.
Can I? Sure, why not.
Keiko, katana! Well now she doesn't have a We're just set on doing this, huh? Yes, we are.

Cyril, get the [BEEP] gun! Okay You're bringing this on yourself! Any time now, Cyril! Pity Probably have to knock five percent off my asking price for the list More than that, I bet.
Seller's market.
Wait wait, stop! Stop! Do you hear that?! No, you tit, the only thing I hear is D-drop it, Spelvin! Oh Cyril I'm warning you! Shoot him! But just him, I think the twins are warming up to me.
Right, you guys? Am I getting some signals? Shut up.
Make me.
Cyril, we both know you can't do it.
Y-yes I can! Then go ahead, Cyril shoot! Just him though! Right? II Don't have it in you.
Don't have it now, didn't have it when you were a wheezy, four-eyed little kid, trying to impress daddy.
How did you fail him? Was it sports? I was all-conference lacrosse.
Pretty demanding sport, pretty tough on the *** This one knows what I'm talking about, right? I see you checking him out.
No not sports, lookit you, shoulders like a trout.
Spelvin What? What was the failure that forever killed the love in your father's heart? Regional spelling bee.
Holy shit You suck at everything! Oh, it's not his fault, he just You whinging little shit.
You just cost me fifty million dollars! But I'm gonna get my money's worth in Ah ah! I've still got one bullet.
Does he? Who am I, CountBulletsula? Like Dracula? That was bad.
Come back to me, I can do better.
I will come back to you.
Because even if you do have one left, you can't shoot all three of us.
No.
Just you.
All right, fair enough.
C'mon girls.
Hey, call me if you ever wanna get that drink.
Either of you, both, whatever.
Unless the sister-thing is weird for you.
I'm obviously way into it.
Alright, Archer you win this round.
No shit, Spelvin.
Well technically I won it, but Jeezy Petes, Archer! Coulda sworn you only fired six.
You coulda blown my foot off! Yeah which you totally deserve after what you did! I'm sorry, okay? And I promise, I'll never do anything like that again! So So what? So do you have to tell anybody? Depends.
You learn anything? Oh God yes, I did, I swear, I learned a huge, valuable lesson that I will remember for the rest of my life! Which you will spend never knowing if I'm gonna rat you out.
What?! Yeah.
So now what'd you learnn? To never confide in you? There ya go.
See? As long as you learn something from it, it's not a mistake.
Okay WhereArcher, where are you going? Well judging from the decor, I'm guessing Spelvin's got one of those kickass Japanese soaking tubs.
Wh-? ! After all that, you wanna take a bath?! Do you not?
